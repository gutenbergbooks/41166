<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>The matter here submitted has been accumulated
upon several hunting trips in the
wilderness, and many excursions from time
to time into the woods and fields about home.
The author has for some years kept more or
less extensive field notes, and has taken numerous
photographs of objects, scenes, or
incidents by the way.</p>

<p>Not all of the narrative is concerned with
the chase, but all has to do with, or is in some
way attributable to, the wanderlust that from
boyhood days has cast its spell over the author
at uncertain intervals, and from time to time,
has compelled a pilgrimage nearer or farther
into the regions of that freedom found only
where man is not.</p>

<p>If in the heart of the reader it sets vibrating
again some chord once sounded by the breath
of the forest, or stirs to harmony some strings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
hitherto not attuned to the music of the great
outdoors, the mission of this volume will not
have been vain, for it will then have assisted
in a modest way the interpretation of that
medium of expression of which Bryant has
said,</p>

<h2><big>Trails and Tramps in Alaska and Newfoundland</big><br />
<br />
CHAPTER I<br />
<br />
CRUISING AND HUNTING IN SOUTHEASTERN ALASKA</h2>

<p>In the midst of the rustling and bustling
on the pier, the creaking of the block and
tackle, and the hoisting of the duffel, could
be heard the loud, clear voice of the mate
resounding in the evening twilight, &#8220;Heave
to!&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s well,&#8221; and similar expressions,
all preparatory to our departure for the far-away
North, the land of glaciers, gold, and
fish. In the crowd were many sorts and
conditions of men&mdash;and not the least in evidence
were the sturdy Norseman and the
Scottish clansman,&mdash;some on pleasure bent,
some in search of the mighty beasts of the
forest, still others seeking their fortune in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
the vast gold-fields stretching on and on
into the great unknown beyond the Arctic
Circle.</p>

<p>Among the ever-changing groups of humanity,
my attention was attracted to one, the
center of which was a young man about one
and twenty. As the time drew near for our
departure, around him gathered four or five
young ladies, who to all appearances were in
sore distress. An only brother, perhaps, was
about to leave home and friends to seek his
fortune in the Land of the Midnight Sun.
The old father, grizzled and gray, stood by
with dejected countenance and folded hands,
the very picture of despair. Presently one
of the girls&mdash;the boy&#8217;s sweetheart, as I afterwards
learned,&mdash;unable longer to stand the
strain, threw her arms about her lover and
wept bitterly. What expressions of sadness
upon the faces of those left behind as the
lamplight casts its pallid rays over them!
And now one staggers and falls into the arms
of a friend. Then what a look of grief upon
the face of the young man peering over the
ship&#8217;s rail! Such is the pathos of life at
every turn, could we but see it.</p>

<p>On board the steamer was the Hon. Walter
L. Fisher, Secretary of the Interior, and his
party, consisting of his son Walter, Alfred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a><br /><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>H. Brooks, of the Geological Surveys Committee,
Governor W. E. Clark of Alaska, and
reporters of various newspapers. Their mission
was to investigate the condition and wants
of the people of Alaska. The genial and
pleasant old sea-dog, Captain Michael Jansen,
was at the helm as the steamer wedged her
way towards the north.</p>

<p>For some two hundred miles we skirted
the eastern shore of Vancouver Island, lined
to the water&#8217;s edge with hemlock, spruce, and
cedar, through which occasionally bluish-white
streaks of water came tumbling down
the mountain-side, each adding its own
particular charm to the scenery. The English
Government has erected along the coast
many lighthouses for the protection of navigation,
but after we passed through Dixon&#8217;s
Entrance into Uncle Sam&#8217;s domain, very few
of these were to be seen. Our Government
seems to have given too little attention to
this matter.</p>

<span class="caption">Myriads of Salmon</span>
</div>

<p>The first stop on the way north was
Ketchikan, a little village nestled snugly at
the foothills, with its hospital, saloons, and
all the usual adjuncts of a mining town. It
has a population of some five hundred souls,
whose principal occupation consists of fishing
and mining. The most interesting thing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a><br /><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>sightseers was a stroll up the boardwalk laid
along a narrow winding stream that has its
origin in the snow-capped mountains. Pitching,
tossing, and foaming it hurried down the
narrow gulch, seeking its level in the briny
deep. It was alive with myriads of salmon,
jumping and leaping in their mad rush to
the spawning ground.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the dawn of the following morning the
boat plowed its way through the green waters
of the Strait toward Annette Island, a strip
of land covered to the water&#8217;s edge with
fir and cedar trees. The island is some
six miles long, and at the extreme end, on
a small, gently sloping plateau, is the
little town of Metlakatla, which boasts a
population of about a thousand persons. It
has its own canneries, saw-mills, and other
industries, and the people seem to be happy
and contented. At the head of the colony
is Rev. William Duncan, who has done much
for the uplift of the many tribes of Indians
in this locality.</p>

<span class="caption">Father Duncan</span>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Father&#8221; Duncan relates that more than
half a century ago, when a young man of
twenty-five, he was living in England. Upon
his ordination as a minister of the Established
Church, Alaska was assigned him as the field<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
of his future life-work. His passage was
paid and he arrived at Victoria after a nine-months
trip. The old man was very much
agitated in relating his early experience. On
reaching Victoria, he of course desired to
enter at once upon his active duties, but the
head official of the town and the captain of
the boat used every means in their power to
persuade him from going among the Indians,
urging that they were bloodthirsty savages
and would surely kill him. He told them
that he was assigned to the field by the
Board and could not think of changing his
plan without an order from his superiors, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
procure which would require at least two
years. He must get to his labor of love
right away. However, he made one request
of the officer in charge of the fort, and it was
this: he would like to spend about nine
months with them in the stockade, and
wished they would send for the brightest
young man of the most powerful tribe, so
that he might learn the language before going
among the savages. They granted his request,
and in nine months he was ready to
deliver his first sermon.</p>

<span class="caption">Guest House</span>
</div>

<p>The Indians were divided into various
tribes, each at war with the other. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
thought if he could succeed in getting the
chiefs together and could tell them the Word
of God in their own language, he would more
readily win their confidence and esteem. So
he requested his interpreter to call together
all the chiefs to one central point, where he
would deliver his first sermon. &#8220;But oh!&#8221; he
said, &#8220;when I saw before me the assembled
braves, decorated in all the colors of the
rainbow, my courage left me, and turning
to my teacher, I begged of him to deliver
the message I had so carefully prepared to
the gathered tribesmen. But he positively
refused, and told me his intrusion might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
cause a war, for the tribes were very jealous
of the power and influence of their neighbors.
Then I took courage and when I had
spoken, oh!
what an effect
it had upon
them! Bodies
were rigid and
eyes seemed as
though they
would pierce me
through and
through. The
results were
striking. They
gathered around
in little groups,
earnestly discussing
the
truths made
known to them
and wondering
who could be and whence came this strange
white man who spoke their own tongue.</p>

<span class="caption">&#8220;Father&#8221; Duncan&#8217;s Church</span>
</div>

<p>&#8220;From that day I became absorbed in my
work. For thirty years I labored among
them at Old Metlakatla, when one day I was
told that the natives did not own the land
and that the title was vested in the Queen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
England. The Indians could not understand
how a sovereign whom they had never seen
could own the land over which they and their
ancestors had roamed for centuries, fishing,
hunting, and trapping.</p>

<span class="caption">Street Scene in Metlakatla</span>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I went down to Vancouver to examine into
the matter, and the Premier and Attorney-General
advised me that such was the case.
I was fearful lest when the Indians learned
this fact they would go on the war-path and
kill every white man in the country. I wrote
a long letter to them explaining conditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and saying that I would be back home to
Old Metlakatla as soon as I could. Shortly
afterwards, much to my surprise, a committee
came to Vancouver to confer with me. When
I saw them I was greatly excited for fear
they had decided upon war. When I inquired
of them what had been done at the
meeting, they refused to tell me, so that I
was considerably worried over the matter.
Although it was late in the evening, I went
immediately to the Attorney-General&#8217;s home
to advise him of the situation. I told him
I would give him all the information I had
that evening, but to-morrow, after I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
learned the action taken, I could not divulge
a single word. I did not sleep much that
night, and in the morning, when I met the
committee, imagine my relief when they
told me they had decided to leave English
territory and seek a new home under
the Stars and Stripes. Shortly after that
I went to Washington to arrange matters,
if possible, for a new location. I finally
succeeded; the United States Government
gave Annette Island to my people for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
their home, and here we have built the
new Metlakatla.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father&#8221; Duncan does not believe in
educating the Indian children as they are
taught at Carlisle and similar institutions.
Once while he was visiting Carlisle at Commencement
time, the orator of the day
advised a graduating class to go out among
the white people and do as the whites did.
Speaking of the occasion, he remarked: &#8220;I
thought as I listened, &#8216;Oh, what a mistake
for them to leave their fathers and mothers,
now too old to work, and become worthless
and idle, unfitted for the duties of life!&#8217;&#8221;
With deep emotion the old man pointed
across the woods toward the cemetery, and
said: &#8220;Over yonder lie the remains of about
thirty young men, the pick of their tribe,
who attended such schools, adopted the
white man&#8217;s mode of living, and contracted
tuberculosis, to which they fall ready victims.
They are by nature so constituted that they
require outdoor life and outdoor exercise.&#8221;</p>

<p>While &#8220;Father&#8221; Duncan was talking, the
Secretary of the Interior came out of the Town
Hall, where he had been holding a conference
with the Town Council, and he and &#8220;Father&#8221;
Duncan walked down the boardwalk toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the cannery and from there to the boat. As
the steamer was about to depart, the passengers
gave three rousing cheers for the grand
old man who had spent fifty-five years of
useful life among these simple children of
nature. Scarcely had the echo of the last
cheer resounded from the hills about the bay,
when, as the steamer left the wharf, the
Indians gave three mightier cheers for the
Secretary and another three for Governor
Clark.</p>

<span class="caption">Indians Cheering the Secretary</span>
</div>

<p>About midnight of the third day the fog-horn
began to blow, repeating the blast
every ten minutes or more, and the engine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
bells tinkled, tinkled all through the night.
Sleep being out of the question, we were up
early the next morning, and to our great
surprise were informed by the pilot that
the <i>Wizard of the Northern Sea</i> had been
caught in the fog and had traveled scarcely
a mile; in fact, we were obliged to return
from the Narrows and wait for the fog to lift.
As the old pilot expressed it: &#8220;Great Golly!
it was a bad night, without a place to throw
the anchor and the current running miles an
hour.&#8221; The old sea-dog had a fine face,
carved with stern lines. As he related with
his Danish accent the stories of how two
men-of-war and several other vessels had met
their doom in those waters, hundreds on
board going down, the little group was all
attention. Even as he talked, he pointed
out the partly concealed rocks where the
men-of-war had met their fate, and over
which the water now broke in innocent-looking
ripples.</p>

<p>After thirteen hours waiting for flood tide
and the lifting of the fog, we steamed slowly
through Wrangel Narrows. What a sight
as the sun dispelled the fog! I have seen at
night in a puddling mill a ball of molten metal
on its way from the furnace to the &#8220;squeezers&#8221;
and, when &#8220;soused&#8221; with water, emitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
a blue flame and vapor. The sun at Wrangel
Narrows was such a ball of molten metal,
while the fog clinging to the leeward side of
the mountain peaks was the vapor, and the
peaks and crags with heads towering far
above the clouds were the stacks and beams
of a monster mill. Occasionally as we glide
along, aquatic birds soar through the air in
search of their morning meal; blackfish sport
in the water, their fins cutting the surface
as they disappear into the depths; and now
a little snipe, flying around and around,
trying to alight on the vessel, causes a stir
among the passengers. A short distance
away appears the head of a seal, evidently
in search of its prey, and the leaping fish tell
the rest of the story. How many things
appeal to the lover of nature!</p>

<p>On account of the swift current and concealed
rocks, the Narrows can be navigated
with safety only in daylight, and I learned
that the policy issued by marine insurance
companies contains a clause under which no
recovery can be had in event of accident to a
steamer while passing through the Narrows
by night.</p>

<p>Here and there lay an old hull cast high
and dry on the rocks, after being tossed and
pitched about in the powerful currents until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
it was battered and broken out of all resemblance
to a boat. The old <i>Portland</i> was
pointed out in the distance, not yet a complete
wreck, her mast erect, hull submerged,
and the breakers booming and splashing over
her. A feeling of sadness came over at least
one of the party at the pleasant recollections
of a former hunting trip made on the <i>Portland</i>
with the big-hearted and greatly beloved
Captain Moore, who has since passed over
the Great Divide.</p>

<p>Wrangel, the next port of entry, was reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
in due time. To the tourists the most noteworthy
objects are the totem-poles. Indian
totem-poles are erected in even the smallest
Indian settlements along the coast as far
north as Sitka. Visitors are always interested
in their picturesque carving. All kinds of
grotesque figures of birds, animals, and fish
are cut into the smooth surface of trees after
the bark is removed. Contrary to what
seems to be a very general belief, the natives
do not worship totem-poles as idols, but
regard them as a sort of family register.
When a great event takes place, in order that
it may be commemorated, they erect a totem;
a successful hunter in the tribe becomes well
known for his deeds of valor,&mdash;straightway
he selects a family crest and up goes his totem,
tinted with all the colors of the rainbow.
Sometimes the poles illustrate legends handed
down from generation to generation,&mdash;the
stories and traditions of this simple-minded
people. Ages ago, according to &#8220;Father&#8221;
Duncan, the Indians adopted totems or crests
to distinguish the social clans into which the
race is said to be divided, and each clan is
represented symbolically by some character,
such as the finback whale, the grizzly bear,
the frog, the eagle, etc. All Indian children
take the crest of their mother and they do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
not regard the members of their father&#8217;s
family as relatives. Therefore a man&#8217;s heir
or his successor is not his own son, but his
sister&#8217;s son. Not often can an Indian be
persuaded to rehearse to a stranger the story
represented by the carvings on a pole. Here
is a legend which is told of one totem-pole:
A very long time ago an old chief with his
wife and two small children pitched his wigwam
at the mouth of a stream when the
salmon were running to spawn. The old
squaw, in order to get some spruce boughs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
with which to gather salmon eggs, pushed
her <i>bidarka</i>, or sealskin boat, into the water,
and telling her two little papooses to get into
the boat, paddled them across the stream.
As she pulled the <i>bidarka</i> up on the other
shore she instructed the children to remain
in the boat till she returned. She came back
in a short time with her load, only to discover
that the children were gone. Many times
she called to them, but always they answered
to her from the woods with the voices of crows,
and when she tried to follow them they would
keep calling to her from some other direction.
She returned to the boat again, gave up the
children for lost, and going back to the wigwam
reported to the chief that an old white trapper
with a big beard had carried away the two
little children. To commemorate this event
they had a totem-pole carved to show the
beard of the white trapper, and frequently
point it out as an example to refractory
children.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our next stop was at Petersburg, a typical
Alaskan town, with its cannery, saw-mill,
and myriads of herring gulls on the wing and
on the water. The old totem-poles which
had stood for many, many years, worn almost
smooth by the constant beating of the ele<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>ments,
excited a great deal of curiosity, and
made one wish for some occult power wherewith
to read the mysteries of the past. At
one pole the party, consisting of several
doctors, was much absorbed, and after considerable
study deciphered the figure of an
old witch doctor carved on the top and below
it what seemed to be a squaw, which they
interpreted as very suggestive of the operation
of laparotomy.</p>

<p>A few miles from Petersburg we saw the
first ice floe with its deep marine coloring,
floating slowly towards the open sea. Two
days and nights of continual rain were very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
oppressive and trying on sociability, but
when the welcome sun reappeared, how
enjoyable was the contrast! The mountain-sides
in the foreground, clad with verdure
from the base half way to the snowy summit,
had for a background the arched dome of
the heavens, filled with vari-colored clouds.
Here and there streams of crystal water
coursed down the mountain-side, whence each
took a final leap over the rocks into the
boiling and seething maelstrom, throwing
spray in every direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>An interesting visit was had to the Treadwell
mine, where the voice of man could not
be heard above the noise of the many stamp
mills pounding away, crushing the low-grade
ores. At six o&#8217;clock the day shift is leaving
the mines and the night force entering. As
the up cage discharges its load of human
freight the down cage is ready, packed so
tightly that it would be almost impossible
for a passenger to turn sideways. Down
into the perpendicular shaft for several hundred
feet the miners descended, and from
there they scattered through the entries
drifted out underneath the bay, where the
best paying rock is to be found.</p>

<p>Juneau, the capital of Alaska, almost directly
across from the mines, was our next
stopping-place. The deck hands, at the command
of the first officer, threw out the gang-plank.
Before it was rightly adjusted, the
crowd was waiting eagerly to get ashore.
The dock was wet and slippery, for it was
raining as usual, the low-hanging clouds
shutting out the view of the snow-covered
mountain-tops in the background. All hunters
in the party made straightway for the
Governor&#8217;s office to secure licenses at fifty
dollars apiece, which entitled each one to
shoot two bull moose. But in order that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
trophy may be brought out of Alaska, the
Act of Congress makes it obligatory to pay
an additional fee of one hundred and fifty
dollars. It seems to me absurd to permit
the killing of moose and to encourage leaving
the trophies where they fall. A subsequent
experience on the Kenai River bore out this
conclusion very forcibly. On the river we
came across a party of hunters from Texas
who had killed a very large moose having a
noble spread of horn. The body was left
to rot on the shore. One of our party who
did not care to shoot would gladly have taken
the trophy home to decorate his den, but the
one hundred and fifty dollars was strictly
prohibitory. I am satisfied this party killed
several moose and left them because the
trophies would not justify the additional
cost of bringing them out.</p>

<p>We spent several hours in Juneau sending
cablegrams and watching a black bear
chained in the middle of the main street.
He was walking around and around, as
though guarding the entrance to the town.
Every person passing kept a safe distance,
but occasionally a visitor unawares approached
too near and afforded fun for
the onlookers when he made a desperate
get-away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>Leaving Juneau the boat turned south
quite a distance in order to reach Sitka. Some
time was lost waiting for high tide before we
could get through the Narrows, full tide being
about eleven o&#8217;clock <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> The night was
very dark and the fog thick, making it difficult
to keep the boat in the channel. As the old
Dane afterwards said, we could keep our
course only by noting the echo of the fog-horn
as it reverberated among the distant hills;
but with great skill we were taken safely
through, and when morning dawned clear
and bright, we found we were fast approaching
Sitka. Many interesting things were to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
seen from the deck as we glided over the
water. The reflection of the mountains was
beautiful and one could scarcely distinguish
the real shore line. Here and there an old
bald eagle (<i>Haliætus leucocephalus</i>) stood
sentinel on some dead tree-top, while the
great blue heron (<i>Ardea herodias</i>) waded
along the edge of the water in search of
something to eat. Thus we were entertained
for hours as we neared Sitka. About noon
the shrill blast of the whistle reminded us
that the town was in sight. Just as soon as
the gang-plank was lowered there was a rush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
for shore, and every person was on his way
to see the sights of Sitka.</p>

<span class="caption">Priests of the Greek Church at Sitka</span>
</div>

<p>The town was founded in 1799 by Governor
Baranoff, a Russian explorer, and is beautifully
situated on Baranoff Island. The old
Russian Greek church stood there just as it
did a hundred years before, with the exception
of a new coat of paint, and the priests
were in their church garb as of yore. Tourists
always visit the old church to see the magnificent
Madonna and other paintings brought
over from Russia in the last century. On
the main street stands the old log-cabin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
erected many years ago by the Hudson Bay
Company and used as a trading post. The
Government has set aside a reservation for
a public park, and many totem-poles have
been set up all along the roadway. Indian
squaws were squatted on the dock selling
their little trinkets, such as miniature totem-poles,
sealskin moccasins, and vases carved
in many forms.</p>

<p>While leaving Sitka the picturesque snow-crowned
Mount Edgecumbe serrated the
horizon on the left, and on the right the sky-line
was much the same. Both shores were
advancing nearer and nearer, and it looked as
though we were in a cul-de-sac. Presently
we passed through Icy Straits, so named
because of the many icebergs which, broken
from a neighboring glacier, find their way
hither.</p>

<p>As we reached the open ocean, &#8220;Gony,&#8221;
as the sailors call the black-footed albatross
(<i>Diomedea nigripes</i>), followed in the wake
of the steamer, porpoise raced with us, rushing
and dodging alongside the boat, occasionally
turning their silver bellies skyward and flaunting
their tails to show how easy it was for them
to keep up with us. The race continued at
intervals for more than an hour before they
disappeared, and by that time the long swells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
of the water rocking the steamer had taken
effect and many of the passengers disappeared
from the decks. Many miles to the right
the purple foothills of the Fairweather range
could be seen. Muir Glacier glittering in the
distance added to the fascination of the
scenery. Along the coast wild strawberries,
with their delicate flowers, their fruit sought
alike by man, beast, and fowl, grew very
abundantly. The weather was just fine and
the conditions right (something unusual in
this neighborhood) to see the great Mount
St. Elias, at least a hundred and fifty miles
due north, and her English cousin, Mount
St. Logan, farther off across the border line.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a><br /><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>The Fairweather range extends for many
miles along the coast. The white ice fields
glitter in the sunshine and at sunset a halo
of many colors hangs over the mountains.</p>

<p>Alaska seems to be a chosen land for glaciers.
The warm Japan stream washes the coast
line, the topography of which is well adapted
to fashion glaciers out of the heavy snowfall
precipitated by the cooling of the humid air
as it strikes the mountains. When the lofty
summits and surrounding fields have accumulated
more snow than they are able to
retain, it gradually advances toward the
valleys. When it leaves the summit it is
soft and flaky, but alternate thawing and
freezing gradually change its condition into
a granulated form of ice. The pressure of
the great body of snow above, the change
of the atmospheric conditions, assisted by
gravity, are the causes which enter into the
formation of the solid glacier ice. These
conditions may be increased or diminished
by earthquakes and mild winters. Like a
great river it advances toward the mouth of
the valley, and as the immense body of ice
moves downward, it brings with it by erosion
huge pieces of rock, earth, and trees. This
debris thrown upon the ice is called moraine,
and where the moraine gathers the thickest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
it protects the ice. When the hot summer
sun thaws the unprotected ice, tiny streamlets
flow from here and there. These gradually
increase in number and size, and as they
grow larger and larger cut their way down
into the ice, forming deep crevasses, and
finally reach bedrock. The interior color
of the crevasses is a deep blue and this changes
to a light blue at the outer edge where exposed
to light. Standing on the brink one
can throw a huge boulder into the opening
and hear it rumbling for some time before
it reaches the bottom. A glacier that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
receding slowly is known locally as a dead
glacier, and one advancing as a live glacier.
However, a live glacier may become a dead
one, and <i>vice versa</i>. A dead glacier has
frequently readvanced after years of inactivity,
carrying with it trees which had grown
up in its course. Columbia glacier in Prince
William Sound is an example of this type.</p>

<p>A tiny snowflake falls on the mountain-top,
is covered in turn by many others, and
disappears for many years. Gradually the
whole mass, by its own weight, is pushed
down into the valley and solidified. Not a
ray of light can penetrate through the thick
glacier ice; the little snowflake has been
completely immured. After years, perhaps
centuries, it finally reappears at sea level,
with myriads of others of its kind congealed
into one solid mass, which breaks off and
floats seaward, clothed in beautiful blue.
But it is such a cold, heartless beauty, for
until melted away the little snowflake is
part of a tremendous mass, whose weight
and silent progress are a constant and dreaded
menace to human life; many a steamer has
been sunk by striking an iceberg.</p>

<p>At the head of Yakutat Bay is situated the
Indian village of Yakutat. It has its cannery
and saw-mill and village church, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
last is a large and very interesting totem
carved out of the butt of a tree. I have
heard it said that these poles are not found
north of Sitka. This one is several hundred
miles farther north. There is only the one,
and it may have been a trophy or a gift. I
was unable to get any account of its past or
any interpretation of its symbolic carvings.</p>

<p>Before we landed we noticed the natives
coming from every possible direction; some
in their canoes, others walking, but all loaded
down with their trinkets to sell to the passengers
on the steamer. When we landed on
the dock the women were squatting on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
floor, all in a row, displaying their goods.
When a kodak was pointed at them they
concealed their faces and demanded &#8220;two
bits&#8221; as the price of a shot. There was
among them a young mother with her babe
whom I was anxious to photograph, but her
price was higher and I was required to raise
the amount to &#8220;eight bits&#8221; before she would
step out into the sun for a snap-shot. I was
afraid to take a time picture for fear she
would &#8220;shy&#8221; before I got it.</p>

<p>The old village, up the shore about a mile,
was reached by a narrow walk along the
coast line. The walk through the sparsely-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>growing
spruce and cottonwood was delightful.
Ravens flew about here and there,
hoarsely calling as we passed by. The undergrowth
consisted principally of berry bushes&mdash;salmon-berries,
blueberries, and red raspberries&mdash;and
as we walked along we gathered
handfuls of the luscious fruit from each in
turn as our taste inclined. When we reached
the village with its wide beach&mdash;for the tide
was out&mdash;our attention was attracted toward
a couple of the native belles, who were sitting
tracing on the sand with their fingers images
of fish, birds, and animals. We approached
suddenly, cutting off their retreat. Being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
naturally shy and timid they ceased writing,
and when they saw us point the camera
toward them, turned their backs. I suggested
to my friend that he walk around to the
opposite side, take out his kodak as though to
photograph them, and when they turned
around I would take a snap, which ruse
worked admirably.</p>

<p>Abandoning the party at this point, I took
a stroll through the woods. There I happened
upon half a dozen native boys shooting at a
mark with guns. They were not aware of my
presence until one of the boys standing apart
from the others noticed what I was doing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Before he got away, however, I had his image
on the film. I walked away a few steps and
sat down on a log to put in a new film. When
I lifted my head, to my surprise every last
one of the little rascals had me covered with
his gun. One emphatic sentence from me
wilted their timid spirits and they skulked
away.</p>

<p>The attractive feature of Yakutat is a
favorable view of Mt. St. Elias. When we
were going up the bay the heavy clouds
shrouded the mountain, obstructing our view,
and how disappointed were the passengers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
as the boat steamed on toward the head of
the bay, where the nearer peaks would shut
off our view of St. Elias, even if other conditions
had been favorable! But when we
were leaving the harbor the same day the
atmospheric conditions were just right to
array the scene in all its splendor. The air
was filled with low floating clouds fringed
with the most brilliant colors from the setting
sun, and as the clouds lifted, the purple
foothills added splendor and enchantment
to the slope that extended its snow-capped
peak eighteen thousand feet into the blue
concave of the heavens. Up to this time
aboard our ship peace, happiness, and sociability
reigned supreme, but when the open
waters of the Pacific were reached and the
&#8220;woollies,&#8221; as the fierce blasts from the icy
ranges are called by the sailors, struck us,
tossing the spray over the pitching, rocking,
and quivering steamer, sociability disappeared
and peace and happiness left the faces of all
the passengers, while the pallor of death
overspread blooming countenances. Thereupon
the fishes became alert and the herring
gulls, gracefully soaring in the wake of the
steamer, uttered their hungry call of expectation.
Surely &#8217;tis an ill wind that blows no
good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>The steamer belched forth the smoke from
its stack as we moved slowly along the coast
toward Katella harbor, the next port of entry.
For fifty miles on the right of us could be seen
the terminal edge of the famous Malaspina
glacier, looking like the white crest of breakers
crashing against a rocky coast. Ahead of
us appeared Cape St. Elias, one of the
most picturesque promontories of Alaska. Its
divided point projected a long way into the
ocean and the captain gave it a wide berth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On reaching Controller Bay the good ship
anchored in the poor harbor. Presently a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
boat, hailing from the revenue cutter <i>Tahoma</i>,
pulled by eight sturdy seamen dressed in
their clean, picturesque suits of blue and
white, drew near the side of the steamer, and
the officer in charge, tall and erect, a fine
specimen of manhood, came up the rope
ladder and made straight toward Secretary
Fisher. In a short time one of the seamen
was on the top deck gesticulating with hat
and handkerchief to the cutter in the distance.
On the cutter could be seen against the sky-line
an ensign going through similar signs in
answer to the instructions given. The Secretary
and his party left the steamer very
quietly without a cheer, and as he arrived on
the cutter the booming of the cannon, repeated
nineteen times, signaled the reception of the
party.</p>

<p>Controller Bay is not a natural harbor and
the problem it presents is whether an engineer
can construct at a reasonable cost an artificial
harbor that will protect vessels from the
terrific gales that sweep the coast during
the winter months. Engineers differ on this
matter; some say that the solution of the
problem is a great dike constructed of concrete,
and others think that a wall could not be
built strong enough to withstand the powerful
currents and massive ice floes of Controller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Bay, and for this reason it is believed that the
only terminal facilities for the Behring coal
fields are at Cordova, by water some hundred
miles farther north.</p>

<p>At the present time a railroad is being built
up the Copper River valley, which is the
natural gateway to the great coal and copper
deposits of the interior and the rich Tanana
Valley. In constructing a railroad up this
valley serious difficulties must be overcome.
The question of labor is very important.
Because of the continual rains and the short
open season the highest wages must be paid.
To get up the valley, it is necessary to cross
the Copper River between two glaciers, and
the topography of the country is such that
it is a difficult engineering feat to construct
a roadbed that will not be carried away by
the spring freshets and the glaciers, which
are continually changing. Miles and Childs
glaciers vary in their movements, at times
receding and again advancing, controlled by
forces which are not fully understood.</p>

<p>Leaving Katella we soon pass Cape Hinchinbrook,
where several steamers have been
cast ashore and wrecked upon the rocky
coast. Entering Prince William Sound we
find the water smoother and a pleasant run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
is made to Cordova, the present terminus
of the Copper River Railroad. Our next
stop was Valdez, with its land-locked harbor.
The town is built practically on the moraine
of a glacier. Sometimes the channel of a
glacier stream changes; in the year 1911 such
a change took place and carried away about
half of the town. In order to prevent a
similar accident in the future, the citizens
turned out and constructed a levee of logs,
rocks, and sand. Valdez glacier extends
down from the summit a distance of twenty
miles, the foot being about five miles from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a><br /><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>the town. During the winter of 1898 gold
was first discovered near Center City in the
interior. The excitement was great at Valdez,
some seven thousand men gathering from all
parts of the States to seek their fortunes. So
great was the rush for the gold-fields that one
continuous procession of prospectors, carrying
all kinds of outfits, passed northward over
the glacier. The following year many perished
on their way out. My guide carried
the mail that year, and on one trip found
seven men who had frozen to death, having
been caught in a storm on the glacier. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
whole party were very weak on account of
scurvy and unable to reach Valdez. When
found, two were lashed to sleds and one was
sitting on a piece of ice, his head resting on
his hands. On the same trip my guide came
upon an old miner frozen to death, still holding
to the handle of his dog sleigh, while the
dog lay curled up in a ball, still alive and still
in the harness.</p>

<p>After spending several days at Valdez,
arrangements were made with the captain
of the <i>Hammond</i> for a small boat to take us
about fifty miles south into Gravenna Bay.
Our little skiff was towed behind all day, and
at five o&#8217;clock in the evening we were informed
by the captain that he was afraid to go up
the bay any farther for fear of striking a
rock. Consequently our camping outfit had
to be piled into our dory in a pouring rain,
and after the captain gave two gongs, as the
pilot shouted, &#8220;Great luck, boys!&#8221; the tug
left us and disappeared around the cape in
the distance. And here we were, fifty miles
from human habitation, dependent for our
return to civilization upon making connections
with this same little tug at its next visit a
month later.</p>

<p>Prepared for the rain with rubber boots
and oilcoats, we pulled towards the head of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the bay, before the wind and on a flowing
tide, so that our little craft fairly glided over
the water. About twilight we pitched camp
in a drenching rain. If there is one thing
more than another which dampens the enthusiasm
for the wild, it is making camp with
everything soaked. But by perseverance in
due time we were getting our supper, snugly
housed in our eight by ten tent, and happier
than kings in a royal palace. To the music
of the rain I soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>In the morning consciousness was restored
by the &#8220;quack, quack&#8221; of the ducks and the
splash of the salmon running to their spawning
ground,&mdash;the occasional wriggling splash of
an old &#8220;humpback&#8221; who had run up the
shore too far and was trying to get back into
deeper water, the loud splash of the high
jumper, and the faint swish of the thousands
on their way to fresh water. After breakfast
I donned my hunting outfit and strolled
along the beach until I reached the mouth
of a small creek which flowed into the bay.
I was amazed at the number of humpback
salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus gorbuscha</i>) ascending
the stream to spawn, some green and fresh
from the briny deep, others changed to a
dark lead color by contact with the fresh
water, and others, struggle-worn, almost with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a><br /><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>out
scales or skin to cover their bodies. They
were running upstream by the thousands.</p>

<p>There was a flock of red-breasted mergansers
(<i>Merganser serrator</i>) on a pool nearby.
I crept quietly to the brink, and, hat off,
peeped over. After the shot was fired it
was interesting to see the flock trying to dive;
the fish were so thickly massed that the ducks
could not get below the surface of the water.
This disturbance caused a rush of the fish and
they madly churned the water in their efforts
to get away from an imaginary enemy. In
shallow riffles the fish were so crowded that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
it was almost impossible to wade across the
stream without being thrown by tramping
upon them or tripped by others trying to
get away. Closer observation showed them
in pairs, rooting their noses into the sand and
gravel to make a hole; in this the female deposited
the eggs and the male covered them
with a milky substance, both turning sideways
at the same time and both flapping their
tails in covering the spawn. Frequently I
could see two males or two females fighting
each other, striking with their tails and biting
like dogs, trying to get possession of a hole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
in the sand in which the spawn might be
deposited. Looking at the horde all tattered
and torn, I could not but admire their pluck
and perseverance in ascending the stream
over stones and other obstacles, with scarcely
enough water to cover half their bodies, in
order that the laws of nature might be obeyed
and the species propagated. When the tide
went out many were caught high and dry
on the shore, and became a prey for birds and
beasts. Thousands of gulls gathered daily,
feeding on the dead fish, and almost invariably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
picking out the eyes first, these being the
choicest morsels, according to their taste.
I have frequently come across fish still alive,
though robbed of their eyes. Our first method
of getting fish was to arm ourselves with
clubs, walk into the shallow riffles, select
some just fresh from the salt water and hit
them with our clubs. We abandoned this
method because several were killed before
we got one that was fresh. We then tied a
halibut hook on the end of a pole and, sitting
on a rock, waited until a fresh fish appeared.
As we caught sight of him some distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
away we would gradually move the hook into
position and land him.</p>

<p>It rained for several days and nights,
causing the water in the creek to rise very
high and run with considerable current. At
this time the shore was salmon-colored with
eggs uncovered by the swift water. All the
fresh streams near camp were so polluted
with dead fish that the water could not be
used, and we were obliged to go above for
some distance to get pure water.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before leaving Valdez we had taken a
little walk out from town, and came across
a small stream of pure ice-cold water that
had its source in the snow of the mountain.
Occasionally could be seen salmon returning
to their spawning ground. I have no doubt
that before Valdez was built the stream was
famous for the annual hordes of fish that
returned to spawn (and, as is believed by some,
to die), but I was told that the number is
getting less and less and now only a very few
frequent the stream. While watching them
our attention was drawn to a dog jumping
into the water and others splashing about,
dashing first in one direction and then another,
trying to catch the fish. How amusing
to see the fish dart between the legs of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
would-be captors, out of the shallows and
into deeper water! Occasionally the dogs
would catch them and bring them to shore.
Had we had the dogs with us at Gravenna
Bay, what sport we might have had!</p>

<p>While writing my notes one evening I
smelled something burning, and on turning
around saw our bed all ablaze, caught by a
spark from the wood fire. If the fire had
caught in our absence it would have been a
very serious matter. Imagine our predicament
to have been without food and shelter,
many miles from civilization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>On one of our side trips we happened upon
an Indian and his family, living in a little hut
constructed of logs and other materials. He
could talk no English and we could not
understand him. After exchanging several
grunts and shaking hands we started to go,
when we noticed his small boy coming towards
us, holding out a paper in his hand.
Opening it, we found the following written
in a legible hand: &#8220;To all to whom these
presents come: This is to notify all miners
and trappers that there are bear traps set
in these diggings.&#8221; My guide was always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
more or less uneasy for fear of stepping into
a steel trap set on a game trail along the stream.</p>

<p>The vegetation along the banks of the
creek was almost tropical in its density, and
when the fish were spawning, bear frequented
the place to catch their prey, which they
carried to the bank and devoured. Often
we could see the remains of fish left partly
consumed, indicating that the bears had been
disturbed at their meal. Doubtless they
had heard the commotion of the fish trying
to get away from us as we ascended the
stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>One day while paddling our little boat
along the water&#8217;s edge, my guide called attention
to an object in the distance which
I was unable to make out for some time, but
which the experienced eye of the hunter had
observed a long way off, though he was unable
to determine exactly what it was. Finally, as
we approached nearer, he exclaimed, &#8220;Caught
his own dog!&#8221; and sure enough, there was
the Indian&#8217;s dog caught in the steel trap
set for bear. The poor fellow was whining
from pain, as though pleading with us
to release him. I wanted the guide to take
him out, but he said the dog might bite
him and we had better notify the owner, for
even if released the dog could never reach
home in his present condition. While coming
along he told the following story:</p>

<p>&#8220;Several years ago there were two white
men trapping on a little stream that emptied
into the Copper River, and one of them was
caught in a steel trap. The bones between
the knee and the ankle were crushed where
the huge iron jaws came together. After
being in the trap for a long time, by almost
superhuman efforts he succeeded in extricating
his leg. Fortunately he was not far from
his boat, and dragging himself over and under
fallen trees he reached the dory, almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
exhausted. Taking the oars he pulled several
miles to reach his cabin. A day or two afterwards
I happened along and found the man
suffering great pain, and saw that unless the
leg were taken off he would lose his life. We
were a hundred miles from a doctor, and
before aid could reach him he would have
died. After talking the matter over with
his partner, it was agreed that I was to cut
the leg off in order to save his life, if possible.
All the tools we had were a hunting knife
and an old rusty saw which had hung in the
cabin for several years. We boiled water
to clean the tools as well as possible, inserted
the end of the old saw in the fire to take off
the rust, retempered the teeth in bear oil,
got deer sinews ready to tie the arteries, and
with these tools I cut the leg off. During
the time I was at work the injured man
frequently advised us what to do. He recovered
from the operation in due time and
is now alive and well.&#8221; My guide afterwards
pointed the man out to me.</p>

<span class="caption">Sunrise</span>
</div>

<p>In this location we spent about a week. We
had no difficulty in killing all the teal (<i>Nettium
carolinensis</i>) and Canada geese (<i>Branta canadensis</i>)
that we cared to eat, and, when the
tide was down, in gathering all the clams
desired. During the month that we spent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
in this part of the country it rained continually,
night and day, with the exception of
three days, which I spent in photographing.
The sun would burst through the clouds like
a huge search-light, casting its rays upon
the tropical luxuriance of the underbrush,
reflecting back a sparkling radiance from
myriads of tiny rain-drops. We changed our
camp occasionally for new grounds, and one
evening we had pitched our tent without
pinning it down. It was raining, as usual,
and after eating a scanty meal we threw our
blankets on the ground and retired early.
Some time in the night I heard the crackling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
of the rank grass. My first impression was
that there was a porcupine skulking near, but
as we listened my guide said, &#8220;There&#8217;s a bear
outside!&#8221; We had thrown down on the
grass at the edge of the tent what was left of a
side of bacon, and Mr. Bruin was trying to
get it from under the canvas. I immediately
jumped up, grabbed my &#8220;405,&#8221; and started
towards the flap of the tent, but about
the time I reached it there came two loud
&#8220;woofs,&#8221; accompanied by the sound of crashing
bushes, and that was the last we heard
of Old Bruin.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>At the head of one of the fiords in the
neighborhood, there was a glacier of considerable
size, and on looking over the desolation
I half expected to find a glacier bear
(<i>Ursus emmonsi</i>). Comparatively little is
known about the habits of this animal. The
only one in captivity is in the public park at
Seattle. It is a fine specimen, and as it
walks up and down behind the bars its wild
nature seems to predominate in every movement.
In the adjoining cages are black and
grizzly bears, but they seem to be satisfied
in captivity, while the glacier bear reminds
one of a hyena as it paces from end to end,
occasionally throwing its head into the air.
The fur is a bluish black beneath, with outer
grayish tips.</p>

<p>In the early morning I started alone in the
direction of the dead glacier, crossed the
glacier stream easily to the opposite side,
which looked more inviting of access, working
my way up over the lateral moraine, searching
among the crevasses, and now and again
getting into a &#8220;pocket,&#8221; from which I had
to retrace my steps. Towards evening I
turned homeward. When I reached the
stream, I thought I had located the ford
where I had previously crossed, but on making
the attempt, I found the water too deep and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
swift. Many times I tried to cross at different
points, thinking each time I had found the
ford. I would wade out into the ice-cold
stream until I felt the swift current almost
lifting me off my feet, and then would
make a hasty return. It was beginning to
get dark and I was anxious to get home, so
I lifted a large stone in my arm to give me
additional weight and started toward a little
eddy, cautiously feeling my way. When I
reached the eddy I felt my feet sinking in
the sand. My first thought was of a quick-sand,
and I shall never forget the sensation
as I hurriedly dropped the stone and made
a mad rush for shore. However, I finally
succeeded in reaching the other side safely.
Before arriving at camp I heard the report of
a gun from the direction of home, for the
guide had grown uneasy and thought I was
lost.</p>

<p>A few more days&#8217; experience in the rain,
among the glaciers, then we broke camp at
high tide and drifted with the ebb flow out
along the shore until we reached the outermost
projection of rocks, and there awaited
the return of the tug which would take us
back to Valdez.</p>

OBSERVATIONS ON KODIAK ISLAND</h2>

<span class="caption">An Island near Valdez</span>
</div>

<p>In the following spring, about the middle
of May, we purchased an outfit at Valdez
for a trip westward along the Alaskan peninsula.
After being bottled up two days in
the port of Valdez, we were anxious to get
started. The steamer approached the narrow
entrance to the harbor, with Fort Liscom,
a Government post, on the left, and on the
right glaciers and wooded foothills. As we
neared the neck it looked as though the
stopper was in the bottle and our exit barred
by an island; but an abrupt curve at the
entrance took us into Prince William Sound,
and in due time along Knight&#8217;s Island and
Latouche Island, where copper is found in
paying quantities. And here is the most
beautiful glacier of Alaska, the Columbia,
with its palisades at times advancing into the
forest and at times receding. A large flock
of phalaropes (<i>Phalaropus lobatus</i>) darting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
back and forth over the surface of the water,
formed geometric figures in the most graceful
manner; occasionally the gray back most
conspicuous and then the silvery underside
shining, each little plume helping to make
one perfect reflection in the water as they
move in regular form, without any disarranging
of the original positions, until they
alight gracefully on the water. The greater
scaup-duck (<i>Aythya marila nearctica</i>), with
its white spots so noticeable as it takes its
occasional upward flight from the water,
is always interesting. However, it prefers
diving out of sight for a place of safety as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the steamer approaches, coming to the surface
from time to time until the boat is quite
near, when, after a last long dive, it is off on
the wing as fast as possible out of harm&#8217;s
way.</p>

<p>In the distance to the westward as we
entered Resurrection Bay, loomed up the
majestic Cathedral Rock, towering skyward
a thousand feet, with the Government survey
cross on the top, and the roaring breakers
washing its foot, filling the coast line with
make-believe soap-suds. Near the water&#8217;s
edge the rocks were white with gulls mating
for the nesting-time. With the consent of
the captain a shot was fired in that direction,
which struck the water some distance from
the rock, and myriads of gulls took to wing
with their wild cry of alarm. Some person
shouted, &#8220;There&#8217;s a whale!&#8221; and all were
anxiously waiting for his reappearance, but
his huge tail had disappeared to us for the last
time. About this time a gull soared gracefully
over the steamer and a fellow-passenger,
rifle in hand, pointed the muzzle at the
bird, and pulled the trigger, bringing down
a feather from its wing. At the same time
the first officer shouted, &#8220;Here, here! Don&#8217;t
shoot that gull! You&#8217;ll bring us bad luck.&#8221;
There is a well founded superstition among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the &#8220;old sea-dogs&#8221; that to kill a gull will
bring bad luck.</p>

</div>

<p>About dusk, as we steamed westward, our
attention was called to Sea Lion Rocks, and
the genial Captain Jansen steered the ship
within five hundred yards of the island in
order that we might see the lions. The
rocks were covered with the large animals,
and they made such an uproar as we passed
that they could be heard a long distance off
above the noise of the breakers.</p>

<p>Along the coast of Kenai Peninsula the
mountains are covered with spruce, hemlock,
and birch, until we enter Resurrection Bay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
at the head of which Seward is built. The
first time I visited Seward it was practically
abandoned. It was the terminus of a new
railroad in process of construction across the
peninsula, having as its objective point the
placer mines of the Susitna Valley. Like
a great many other projects of this kind,
there was not sufficient money subscribed to
finish the undertaking, and the company
was forced into the hands of a receiver.</p>

<p>The next stop on our way west was Seldovia.
The old Russian church where we
attended services was built on a little knoll
that overlooked the harbor, and from it we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a><br /><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>could see the native burial ground with its
dilapidated grave marks. When we entered
the church the natives did not seem to be
much interested in us. While the sermon
is being delivered the women occupy one
side of the house and the men the other.
During the services they paid close attention
to what was going on. There were no seats
in the church and all the parties stood during
the entire time of worship. When the incense
was being burned, filling the room with
sweet fragrance, the expression on the features
of the worshipers manifested a devout frame
of mind and spirit not often in evidence.</p>

<p>In the harbor were hundreds of gulls,
floating leisurely on the surface of the water
or standing on the logs that drifted with the
tide.</p>

<p>Among the passengers on the steamer was
a delicate little lady with her three-year-old
child, who was on the way to meet her husband
at Iliamnia, some sixty miles across
the bay. I remember how indignant the
passengers were when they learned there
was no person present to meet her when she
arrived, and no prospect of her getting across
Cook&#8217;s Inlet for more than a week. A purse
was raised among the passengers, all contributing,
and with the aid of the captain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the revenue cutter, who in ordinary cases
would take no passengers, the little lady
was started on her trip across the Inlet the
following morning, happy in the expectation
of meeting her husband.</p>

<p>While crossing the entrance to Shellicoff
Straits we encountered a very rough sea and
the steamer tossed and pitched among the
billows. That evening, as we steamed towards
Kodiak Island, the clouds were fringed
with pink and purple and through a rift the
sun illuminated sky and water with all the
splendor and brilliance of those northwestern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
sunsets. Passing to the left of Afognak
Island, we entered the harbor at Kodiak.
The village, with its Greek church similar
in structure to the old chapel at Sitka, is
built on a plateau and surrounded with sloping,
verdure-clad hills. The population consists
of about four hundred, a few of them
whites, the rest Aliutes and Creoles. The
ravens (<i>Corvus corax principalis</i>) were very
plentiful, and their croaking could be heard
in all directions. One old fellow continually
perched on the top of a shanty used as the
district jail. Two of the prisoners were
permitted to wander around, cut firewood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
for the warden, plant seed and the like. Once
when the planter was putting in seed at one
end of the row and the raven picking it out
at the other, we heard the former call out,
&#8220;Shoo, shoo, <i>you&#8217;ll</i> be put in jail for stealing
next.&#8221;</p>

<p>We arrived in Kodiak on the morning of
May 26th, and immediately began our preparations
for the hunt. On our way up we
became acquainted with the United States
Marshal, who kindly invited us to stop at
his home until we could arrange matters to
go farther westward on the island, where we
expected to hunt.</p>

<p>My guide was a man who had spent his
early life on the plains as a cow-puncher and
trapper. One day he told me that he and a
friend left their mountain camp to sell their
winter&#8217;s catch. It was getting less and less
each year because of the slow but sure disappearance
of wild life, as the white hunters
and trappers increased and the demand for
furs grew. He was in love with a daughter
of the plains and had returned in the spring
with the results of his winter&#8217;s work, intending
to lay his all at the feet of his lady love.
The season had been against him in his
search for furs. The heavy snows had kept
the fox and lynx from making extensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
forages from their dens, and the low temperature
before the snow came froze the creeks
so solid that the mink, otter, and beaver were
forced to remain indoors the greater part of
the time. The winter had been long and
severe, the catch was poor, and he left his
traps late in the spring when the pelts were
beginning to look hairless. Thus he left
his occupation in the solitude of the wilds
with a heavy heart, for the previous fall
when he bade adieu to his fair fiancée, full
of hope and expectation, with the promise
of a large yield, he was sure of sufficient
funds to purchase a meager home. When
he reached the frontier town he could not
muster up courage enough to see her, but
disposed of his stock, sold his outfit and all
his belongings, and made a bee-line for California;
thence he took the first steamer for
the Yukon. About this time a strike was
made at Nome and hundreds of gold seekers
had gathered. There was a great demand
for fresh meat, so he conceived the idea of
constructing a raft in the upper waters,
loading it with moose meat, and then floating
the flat to Nome and getting rich quick.
About the time he was ready to start with
a full load, Congress passed an act making
it unlawful to sell or have in possession any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
wild game. On his way down he was stopped
at the Government fort, put under arrest,
and his load confiscated. He argued his
own case well, for he got off without imprisonment.
After spending several years
there he returned to Seattle, and sent for his
little girl from Montana; they were united
for better or worse, and together they left
Seattle and landed on the Alaskan Peninsula,
where they spent three years hunting and
trapping.</p>

<p>I visited their clean, tidy home in Seattle,
was very much delighted, and spent many
pleasant hours listening to the wife&#8217;s stories
of her experiences. Among other things
she said: &#8220;My husband shot during the
three years over one hundred of the big
brown bear for the hides. My part was to
assist him with the skinning and do the
general housework. On one occasion he had
shot a big bear and had placed his gun a short
distance away while he proceeded to skin
the animal. About the time the steel entered
the skin the bear jumped up, uttered a hair-raising
growl, and as I ran away, Grant
grabbed his gun and finished the bear. I
tell you that was exciting. For a whole year
we did not see a soul at camp, and when we
wanted provisions, Grant would make a trip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
across Akuton Pass to Unalaska to do the
buying. One day he left me in the morning
with a large Malamuth dog for my sole companion,
saying he would return on the morrow.
When the morrow dawned it brought with it
one of the worst storms that had swept the
coast for years, so bad that even one of the
large steamers could not live it out, and was
destroyed on the rocks nearby. The storm
kept up for four days, and just imagine me
alone during those four long, weary days,
wondering if Grant had been lost, and what
I would do if such were the case.</p>

<p>&#8220;The dawning of the fifth day found me
looking in the direction of Unalaska, hoping
and praying that he might return safely. A
little black speck in the blue distance caught
my eye. At first I thought it was a bird
skimming over the water, but as I looked
again and again it seemed to float on the
surface. My spirits rose, and the longer I
looked the more certain I was that it was the
little boat. Oh! what was my joy as the tiny
object increased in size as it advanced nearer
and nearer until I recognized the little dory
and the frantic waving of hat and hands of
Grant as he approached closer and closer!
The climax came when I recognized his whoop,
as he saw me standing on the beach with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
arms open to receive him, and woman-like,
I proceeded to swoon away.</p>

<p>&#8220;The very next trip I determined to go
with him. We set sail in our little schooner
with a strong fair wind, but before long a
fierce gale struck us and was carrying us
toward sure destruction on the reef, where
the angry sea would have made kindling
wood of our frail craft. We cast the anchor,
but it dragged, dragged, and would not take
hold, and all the while we were drifting nearer
and nearer the reef. Grant had given up
all hope, and said: &#8216;Mollie, dear, it&#8217;s all up!
We&#8217;re lost!' I encouraged him, saying that
there was still hope, when, much to our relief,
the anchor took hold and the bow turned
to windward on the very verge of destruction.
It held fast all night. As the dawn began to
appear the wind shifted, and hoisting our
little sail we tacked back and forth to Unalaska.
We started on our return trip, but
luck was against us; we were blown far out
to sea, and for four long days and nights we
drifted, we knew not where. Almost the
entire time Grant had his head up through
the hatchway, around his neck a canvas
spread over the hatchway, to keep the breakers
from filling the boat, and many, many
times I cheered him with a cup of strong tea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Grant had given up all hope of reaching land,
when gradually the wind shifted, blew from
the opposite direction, and took us straight
to shore.&#8221;</p>

<p>On one of their hunting trips to Knight&#8217;s
Island, Grant prospected a little on the side
and staked a copper claim which &#8220;panned
out&#8221; very well, but which eventually cost
the life of a partner, who was caught in a snow
slide the following spring.</p>

<p>I bade her good-bye as we left Seattle, when
she said: &#8220;Oh! how I long to return to Alaska!
Before I went there I was a very delicate
girl and had very poor health; in fact, the
opinion of the family physician was that I
did not have long to live; but roughing it in
the open air seemed to be a tonic and built
me right up. Is it any wonder I love Alaska
and long for its wild free life?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kodiak is a charming little village. The
natives are lazy and spend most of their time
in fishing and hunting. We hired a couple
of Aliutes, who owned a schooner, to take
our equipment to the camping ground. Our
course lay around the northeastern end of
Kodiak Island, thence westward. After
starting, we were becalmed for some time to
leeward of the rocky coast. Along came a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
couple of natives, who towed us out a few
hundred feet from behind the island, and
presently the sails began to fill. As though
it were human, the schooner responded to
the gentle breezes and away we went toward
the open seas. We had to round a distant
point in order to get into another bay. With
a fair southeast wind we dropped anchor at
six o&#8217;clock some thirty miles west of Kodiak.
We followed the shore line with its picturesque
scenery of snow-clad hills covered with scrubby
trees, mostly cottonwood and spruce. Here
and there the tundra, like a great meadow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
fringed with alder, added charm and interest
to the surroundings. The waters of Shellicoff
Straits threw their breakers far up on the
beach, and an occasional whale would spout in
the distance. We passed an island covered
with different species of gulls nesting on the
rocks; it was just the beginning of the nesting
season for aquatic birds.</p>

<p>After several days of these interesting
sights, the sailboat entered a beautiful little
fiord, where we cast anchor for the night. On
the following day we landed our equipment,
dismissed the Indians with their boat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
pitched our tent in a little sheltered nook
among the cottonwoods, where we expected
to spend several weeks in hunting and photographing
the great Kadiak bear (<i>Ursus middendorff</i>).
The snow had disappeared for about
a third of the way up the mountain, visible
beyond foothills densely overgrown with alder,
elder, and other bushes. The rocky shore,
treeless, save for a stunted cottonwood here
and there, was covered with many varieties
of beautiful spring flowers. A cluster of
fragrant forget-me-nots among the mosses,
another of crowfoot, with the long dry grass
of the previous year for a background, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
bunch of pinks with a similar setting added
life and color to the rugged surroundings.</p>

<p>While climbing for a specially beautiful
bunch of forget-me-nots I came across a crow&#8217;s
nest (<i>Corvus americanus</i>) under a ledge of
rocks. In the nest were several young crows
waiting for the mother bird to return to
appease their hunger. The bald eagles (<i>Haliætus
leucocephalus</i>) were very plentiful and
there were several nests built in the vicinity.
Never having had any experience with eagles
rearing their young, I suggested to my guide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
that I would climb one of the trees to the
nest and see what effect it would have upon
the birds. He insisted that it was dangerous
to climb the tree, but could not persuade me
to forego the experience. At my request
he stood guard near the foot of the cottonwood,
with instructions to shoot the birds if
they came too close. Taking off my shoes,
coat, and hat, I started to climb the tree as
the old birds were soaring quite a distance
above. As I climbed higher and higher the
birds came nearer and nearer, and when I
was about half way up the guide tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
persuade me to come down, for the birds
were getting dangerously close. When I had
covered about two-thirds of the climb, one
of the birds came so near that I could feel
the wind from his wing, when &#8220;crack&#8221; went
the gun and down went the bird. I remonstrated
with him for shooting the bird, for it
was not close enough to do any harm. He
again insisted that I come down, saying that
the other bird would strike me and knock
me off the tree, but I still persisted in going
higher, with the male coming nearer and
nearer. On one of its circlings it struck me
lightly on the head with the tip of its wing.
The guide said, &#8220;Is that close enough?&#8221; and
threw his gun up as though to shoot the bird,
but I insisted that he should wait a little.
All the time my eyes were fixed on the eagle.
As he made the next swoop, if I had not
dodged behind a limb he would surely have
knocked me off with his wing. Again the
gun cracked, the bird pitched head-on and,
meteor-like, dropped to the ground with a
thud.</p>

<span class="caption">Eagle Watching for Prey</span>
</div>

<p>Climbing up to the nest, I found it was
built of sticks. Some on the margin of the
nest were as large as one&#8217;s wrist, those nearer
the center were smaller, while the nest proper
was lined with grass. The nest over all had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
a diameter of about six feet. In it were
three little eaglets, possibly two days old,
and around the nest were the remains of
several species of birds, such as ducks,
ptarmigan, and kingfishers, also pieces of
fish, to feed the young. When I saw the
destruction of life I felt, in common with the
guide, that eagles should not receive too much
consideration at the hands of the Nimrod.
He was anxious to shoot every eagle in sight,
as he said many a nice piece of fur caught
in his traps had been destroyed by them.
Knowing that both the parent birds were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
dead, I thought it a pity to leave the young to
die of starvation. Pulling my bandanna handkerchief
out of my pocket, I carefully stowed
away the little birds in the pack, swung it over
my arm, and slid down to the ground.</p>

<span class="caption">Eagle&#8217;s Nest and Young</span>
</div>

<p>On the lower branches of the same tree a
pair of magpies (<i>Pica pica hudsonica</i>) had
built their nest in the usual way, covered
over to the depth of at least a foot with limbs
and sticks, its small entrance at the side,
evidently in pursuance of the natural instinct
of the birds for the protection of their nest
and young. It occurred to me as strange that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
both of these birds, carnivorous and well
known as destroyers of eggs and nests, seemed
to live happily together, though the eagle,
if it so desired, could have destroyed the nest
of the magpie with one grip of its powerful
talons.</p>

<p>We took the young eagles to camp, fed
them for several days, and the amount they
could devour of fresh codfish, cut up in large
chunks, was surprising. They would fill
their craws so full that they looked like
pouter pigeons.</p>

<p>For several days we observed with the field-glass
that a bald eagle had built its nest away
up among the crags at the end of a projection
on one of the peaks. We noticed that the
old bird spent a great deal of time on the
nest, and we knew she was hatching. After
discussing the matter, we decided to take the
young eagles and put them in the nest to be
reared by the foster-mother. About dawn
we started for the eyrie on the cliffs, with our
kodak, gun, and the young eaglets. After
climbing three or four hours we reached a
point above the rocks, and then by advancing
cautiously, sliding and crawling, we safely
reached the nest. I had given the guide
positive instructions that he was under no
circumstances to kill the old birds, but scare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
them away by shooting into the air occasionally.
He took a position a little above where
he could command a good view of the birds
and keep guard over me while I was photographing
the nest. There were two pale buff
eggs (size 2.75 × 2.10) in the nest, and while
I was arranging my camera an occasional
report from the gun in the hands of the guide
kept the eagles at a respectful distance.
While setting up the kodak I heard the &#8220;peep,
peep&#8221; of the little eaglets in the eggs trying
to get the first sight of day, and about the
time everything was ready to take the picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the egg cracked, with the result that I obtained
a picture of the little bird just coming
out. We left our two little eagles with the
others, worked our way down the mountain-side,
and since then I have often wondered
if the foster-mother reared the young.</p>

<p>We decided to change our camping-ground
into the adjoining fiord. Taking the twenty-foot
tide at flood, as we thought, we were a
little slow in starting, had some difficulty
getting out, and before we reached deep
water were caught and left high and dry on
a shoal, where we were obliged to remain for
several hours, waiting for the return of the
tide. During the interim we waded to shore
and scoured the neighboring hills in search
of some evidence of Bruin. We found none,
and by the time we came back to the water&#8217;s
edge, the tide had set in so far that we were
forced to wade for a quarter of a mile to our
boat. The latter was heavily loaded, but as
the current caught it, it moved gently at first,
then at last cleared the sandbar. With a
strong wind blowing, we were carried out to
the promontory just about the time the tide
was turning and the flood tide carried us up
to the head of the adjoining bay. The
breakers were running high on the point and
it was with the greatest difficulty that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
were able to get around with our dory.
Frequently the wind blew the spray all over
us, and by the time we reached the return
tide on the other side I was greatly exhausted
and gave a sigh of relief, for conditions were
such that we were afraid our little dory could
not stand much more of the kind of sea that
was running. Once around on the other
side the wind changed, and with the inflow
of the tide and our little leg-of-mutton sail,
we were carried with race-horse speed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
head of the bay. We steered for a small
island, and as we approached, many gulls,
sea-parrots, and ducks were flying around
the bay. We landed the dory on the beach,
and climbed the rocks while the birds hovered
about us by the thousands, uttering their
shrill cries of alarm as we gathered a few
fresh eggs for breakfast on the morrow.
Sea-parrots (<i>Fratercula arctica</i>) were quite
numerous, and many left their holes in the
rocks, startled no doubt by the warning given
by the gulls. Peeping down into one of
the crevices I discovered a sea-parrot&#8217;s nest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
with the female sitting on it. In order to
get in to the nest it was necessary to pass
horizontally between the rocks and drop
vertically about five feet into a small, cavern-like
space. Being anxious to photograph
the nest, I discarded a part of my clothing,
entered the hole feet first, with the guide
holding on to me until my feet reached solid
ground. Having a pair of buckskin gloves
on my hands I caught the parrot, and at the
same time the parrot caught me with its
powerful beak, and if it had not been for the
gloves I would have received an ugly bite.
I handed the bird and her one dull-white-and-lilac-marked
egg to the guide, who
placed the bird in my kodak box until he
helped me out. I had considerable difficulty
in getting out at the hole by which I had
entered, for to do so it was necessary for
my body as it emerged to be at right
angles with the wall rock. When I did succeed
in getting out, with the aid of my guide
pulling and tugging, I was minus considerable
clothing.</p>

<p>A little farther down the rocks we came
to a white tern&#8217;s nest (<i>Gygis alba kittlitzi</i>),
viz, an egg laid upon the bare rock without
a vestige of any structure. In color it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
bluish white, with large liver-colored spots.
It is said of these birds that are very
reckless in laying their eggs, at times selecting
a bare limb, and how they succeed in incubating
under certain conditions is remarkable.</p>

<p>We passed about two weeks in this location
in the most ideal weather, without pitching
tent, sleeping on the ground rolled in our
blankets, our canopy the heavens glittering
with myriads of stars overhead. The days
were long and we spent most of our time
from two o&#8217;clock in the morning until eleven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
at night where the bear love to roam. They
were just coming out of hibernation and had
not yet started to feed. During my brief
experience I observed from the tracks in the
snow that the bear do not eat anything for
the first two or three days, then gradually
descend toward the snow-line and begin to
nip the new grass. While the salmon run
their principal diet is fish. With the glasses
we could see several trails of Old Ephraim
where he came over the very highest peaks
of the snow-capped range, quartering down
and again returning to the higher altitudes,
where he evidently spent his time at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
season of the year. On one occasion we
pitched camp about dusk, ten o&#8217;clock, and
having gathered a good supply of last year&#8217;s
ferns for bedding, rolled ourselves up in our
blankets and forgot we were tired until five
o&#8217;clock the next morning.</p>

<p>A good hot breakfast limbered up our
stiff joints considerably, and in about an hour
we were starting for the trails in the snow of
the summit. Up we went, steadily and
slowly, at an angle of forty-five degrees until
we reached the snow-line, when we struck
the bear trail where he first had descended
the mountain. A part of the time he had
come down on his tail, judging from the
slides we found occasionally. He had circled
around quite a distance and ascended again
without even nipping a blade of grass, although
in the snow-slides the grass was
beginning to grow. Taking the trail we
started after him up the mountain, but a
more difficult task one could not well imagine.
Part of the time the wet snow was up to our
waists and all the time over boot-tops. Up
and up we went on the trail until we reached
the drift snow of the side summit, where we
were obliged to crawl on hands and knees
in order to get over. Then our task was
easy for some time and we found many old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
trails on the top. We were satisfied that the
bears were not yet feeding.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Returning along the mountains we saw
quite a few small snow-slides. On one
occasion while crossing between two ridges
my companion startled me by shouting,
&#8220;Run, for Heaven&#8217;s sake!&#8221; At the same
time he made a dash towards the ridge.
My first thought was, &#8220;A bear!&#8221; But almost
instantly I realized our danger, as a snow-slide
that had started above from some unknown
cause, came thundering down, almost
upon us. (It is said that under certain conditions
the report of a gun may start a slide.)
As it descended, gathering speed and bulk
and as the loose snow slid over the hard crust,
it sounded like a strong wind roaring through
the trees. In speaking about his long experience
in Alaska, my guide informed me
that he was more afraid of a snow-slide than
of all the grizzlies in the country. He said
that in the spring of &#8217;98, in what was known
as the Sheep Creek slide on the Chillcoot
Pass, he helped to dig out of the snow fifty-two
dead bodies of gold-seekers who were
caught on the trail in a big snow-slide, among
them being one woman.</p>

<span class="caption">Our Camp among the Cottonwoods</span>
</div>

<p>The next morning, just as soon as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a><br /><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>regular routine of getting breakfast was over,
we again started up the mountains in search
of the quarry. The hunting was the hardest
I have ever experienced, the mountains being
a series of peaks and hollows, at the base
covered with a dense growth of alder and
underbrush, the rocks and crevices hidden
beneath moss, dry ferns, and leaves. As we
ascended we found less moss and alder and
more long grass. The snow had packed the
latter flat on the earth and it was as slippery
as ice. At each step we were sure to slide
if the greatest effort and care were not taken.
When we reached the snowy top, as far as
the eye could see, peak after peak pushed its
head above the clouds, looking like huge
sentries, standing guard over an untrodden
domain. We scrutinized every suspicious-looking
object with the field-glasses in the hope
of descrying a bear. Working our way down
over the snow, occasionally sliding &#8220;hunker&#8221;
fashion or dropping into a hole between the
rocks, greeting with a quiet &#8220;damn&#8221; an alder
switch in the eye or a devil&#8217;s club jagger in
the hand, we finally reached the valley.</p>

<p>Along the shore of the stream I observed
the beaten paths that the bear had worn to a
depth of twenty inches at places, evidently
where they had been travelling up and down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the stream fishing for many years. Each
morning as soon as we opened our eyes we
reached for the field-glasses and carefully
scanned the mountain-sides for fresh signs.
One morning the guide, after looking long and
carefully, called my attention to three bears
circling up the mountain. We watched them
climb higher and higher until they finally
disappeared over the backbone of the ridge
just about the time we were ready to follow.
The foothills were covered at least a third
of the way with dense alder and other tangled
underbrush that made it very difficult to get
through. By the time we reached the snow-line
we were tired out and stopped a short
time for a rest. Occasionally a ptarmigan
would start up, uttering its plaintive, croaking
notes as it took to wing. Some were all
white in their winter coats, others were
partly in their brown summer plumage.
Again we plowed our way up through the soft
snow, sinking deeper and deeper as we ascended
the mountain, a hot sun adding to
our discomfort. The guide was in advance
and I followed, stepping in his tracks. Even
with our snow glasses it was almost impossible
to see. The glitter of the snow affected the
eyes, though the eyelids, heavy and red,
were almost closed and the tears trickled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
down our cheeks. Half the time I could not
see at all. Sometimes the guide would go
into the snow up to his knees and again to
his waist into a crevice, which could then
be avoided by his follower. Plodding along
we reached almost the top of the snowy peak,
now enveloped in a canopy of fog, and there
we were in the midst of a snowstorm that was
so dense we could scarcely see, and all that I
could distinguish was a black object about
three feet in advance. Finally the guide called
out that it was foolishness for us to track the
bear under present conditions, and suggested
that we circle around the peak and catch
their trail on the other side. In a short time
we were out of the snowstorm and, tramping
around the cone of the mountain, struck the
trail, which went straight down the other
side toward the valley. Occasionally one
of the bear would take a notion to sit down
and slide many yards. This habit rubs the
hair off rapidly, and if they are not killed
shortly after they leave winter quarters the
hide is practically ruined. When we got down
below the snow-line the bear took to the
alder, where we found it was much more
difficult to follow the trail. About noon we
took off our shoes, wrung out our socks, now
soaking wet with snow water, and hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
them up to dry while we slept for about
three hours on the bare ground. Then we
took the trail again across the opposite
mountain, but finally had to give up, for we
were unable to overtake the game.</p>

<span class="caption">An Extinct Crater where the Bear Hibernate</span>
</div>

<p>Two days afterwards we started up the
valley, when the guide happened to look
back and pointed out a large bear ascending
the mountain about half a mile behind us.
Through the field-glasses we watched him
climbing; frequently he would look back,&mdash;evidently
he had gotten a whiff of us as we
passed him in the valley below. Occasionally
he would disappear behind a little knoll and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
again appear, at the same time gradually
ascending the mountain. Finally he went
out of sight behind a knoll and we waited
for about twenty minutes to see if he would
show himself again before we started after
him. We concluded that he had lain down
on the knoll, and after fixing the location as
best we could, we started to climb the mountain,
first through the thick alder until we
reached the snow-line, then plowing our
way through the snow, using the guns for
alpenstocks, as the climbing was very difficult.
When we reached the knoll where
the bear was concealed we advanced cautiously,
puffing like &#8220;wind-jammers&#8221;&mdash;full
of excitement at the thought of the quarry
being so near.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">Where He Fell</span>
</div>

<p>The guide was just pointing out to me the
back track in the snow beyond, when old
Bruin raised up on his hind quarters, opened
his mouth, and let out two of the most awful
growls one could imagine. At the same time
the guide exclaimed, &#8220;Get to him, there he
is!&#8221;&mdash;only his language was a little more
forcible. With that the bear dropped on
all fours, head advanced as though he was
going to charge. Before I had time to take
a shot he wheeled, disappeared for a second
in a little depression beyond, reappeared on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the other side at a distance of about forty
yards, going down the mountain at a rapid
gait. I fired my first shot from a &#8220;405,&#8221;
but there was no indication that I had touched
the mark. I pumped in another shell and
fired again, with no better results; again I
threw the gun to my shoulder, pulled the
trigger, but there was no explosion. I must
have been a little excited, for I did not push
the lever far enough, consequently it did not
throw the shell into the chamber. My guide
by this time was very much excited and
insisted upon taking a shot, while I demanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
one more chance. All this time the bear
was going down the mountain-side at a rapid
pace. By the time he was a hundred yards
away I fired the last shot and he made one
headlong plunge into the snow.</p>

<p>Much to my surprise, although I had frequently
heard of the remarkable vitality
of the grizzly, we found upon examination
that the first shot had passed through the
heart and through the entire body, as indicated
by the hole on the other side. The
second time I fired I overshot and the last
charge quartered through the lungs and came
out at the left shoulder. Thus he had run
at least fifty yards after receiving his death
wound, and I have no doubt would have run
a long way if it had not been for the last shot
that brought him down. We left the bear
where he fell in order to get a photograph,
and it was necessary to make a special trip
back with the kodak, which we did the following
day.</p>

<p>Working our way down the mountain trail
to the valley we ate our lunch, and took a
nap. On awakening we advanced toward the
head of a beautiful little lake artistically located
in a basin of half snow-clad hills. The
silence, save for the crackling cry of the ptarmigan
(<i>Lagopus lagopus</i>) as they left their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
snowy bed in great alarm, was awe-inspiring.
A little beyond the head of the lake we were
confronted with a mountain stream which
to me looked impassable owing to the swiftness
of the current. In a few seconds the guide
stepped into the ice-cold water, at the same
time commanding me to get on his back,
and in this way he ferried me across with the
water almost carrying him off his feet. Later
in the afternoon our progress was again
checked by a torrent, the sight of which
caused me to say, &#8220;It&#8217;s impossible for us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
to cross this stream, we&#8217;ll have to go back
the way we came.&#8221; My companion followed
the stream up and down a short way until
finally he came to a cottonwood tree about
two feet in diameter. Taking his coat off
and reaching for the small axe in his belt,
in a short time he felled the tree right across
the creek, and by this footbridge we passed
over without any difficulty. About ten
o&#8217;clock in the evening, as we worked our way
down the precipitous chasm, we came upon
an obstacle that we could not overcome.
The gorge was perhaps ten feet wide and we
were working our way along on the left of
the stream. As we rounded a curve we
found that just ahead the course of the
torrent was deflected by a boulder on the
right, so that it rushed to the left and point
blank against a projecting rock directly in
our path, effectually cutting off our progress.
It was quite an undertaking to get out of the
pocket we were in, and it required the alternate
assistance of each to accomplish the
undertaking. With occasionally a boost and
then a pull, and so on, we finally climbed
pretty well up to the top, where we could
start anew down to the shore a little beyond
the canyon. By this time the shadows cast
by the midnight sun were lengthening fast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
We began to realize our position, tired and
hungry, without food, waiting around the
camp fire for six hours for the ebb tide that
we might get over to our boat. The guide
could not content himself very long and
started to work his way around a rock projection.
In the undertaking he fell into the
water, and instead of trying to get out, made
a bold dash across the stream and pulled
himself up on the rocks on the opposite side
like a half-drowned rat. In a short time he
returned with the boat and ferried your
humble servant across. By this time it was
getting quite cold and he was threatened
with chills, so to keep up the circulation he
applied the oars furiously to reach our tent,
which fortunately was not far away. Hurriedly
changing his clothing and wrapping
himself up in blankets, he brought on the
reaction about the time I had a pot of strong
hot tea ready to administer.</p>

<p>On our wanderings around the island we
frequently came upon an abandoned winter
home of the natives. They fish and trap
principally, for a livelihood. Early in the
fall they take their families into some remote
nook, build a <i>barabara</i> out of logs, thatch
the entire outside surface with native red-top
hay to keep out the cold, and pile large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
logs all over the hay to keep it from blowing
away. They dry salmon, cod, and flounders
for their winter supply. When the fur becomes
prime they set their traps for fox,
ermine, and land otter, and in this way eke
out a miserable existence. It is said of them
that in their early days they were honest to a
fault, theft being punished by death, but on
associating with the whites they acquired all
the faults of the latter with none of the good.</p>

<p>The dawn of another day brought a hazy
sky and the indications foretold wet weather.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
True to our expectations it rained the greater
portion of the day. In the afternoon it
cleared up somewhat and towards evening
the sun came out bright. We then visited
Gull Island to get a few fresh eggs for breakfast.
The Arctic tern (<i>Sterna paradisæa</i>)
had a large community on the rocky island.
When we approached they hovered over us
in great numbers. The kittiwakes (<i>Rissa
tridactyla</i>) also had a colony. In many
nests on the island, the eggs were blotched
and streaked in various shades. They were
about the size of an ordinary hen egg, were
palatable, and we used quite a number to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
make pancakes. After photographing several
nests with eggs and a few wild flowers that
grew very abundantly on the rocks near the
water&#8217;s edge, we returned to camp, had
supper, consisting of eggs, bear steak, etc.,
after which we retired for the night about
ten o&#8217;clock, it being still almost daylight,
for during June the days are twenty-two
hours long.</p>

<p>We again desired to change our camp into
the adjoining bay, so we pulled stakes and
started for a fifteen-mile trip. The tide was
in our favor, but with a head wind we pulled
our little dory down to the turning point,
where tide and wind helped us on our way.</p>

<p>When we were about half-way up we came
upon a camp of Italian fishermen who had
just arrived from &#8220;Frisco&#8221; to fish for salmon
during the season&#8217;s run. We turned our
boat towards shore and landed to meet our
neighbors. They were a villainous-looking
lot, about two dozen in all, and could speak
no English, except the foreman, and we could
understand him only with difficulty. We
succeeded in letting him know we were anxious
to have a few fish for supper, and soon several
of the men were making a haul with the
seine for our special benefit, so we had all
the fish we wanted. After exchanging com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>pliments,
our little sail was hoisted, and as
the boat sped over the water we waved a
good-bye to the &#8220;bunch,&#8221; although we understood
they wanted us to spend the night
with them. Before we had gone very far
the wind died down to a gentle breeze, and
much to our disappointment we had to take
down our sail, for it flapped around like a
wounded bird, here, there, and everywhere,
without wind enough to make it taut. We
took the oars about seven o&#8217;clock and before
long the water became so calm that the
snow-capped mountains reflected their peaks
on the waters of the bay, seeming to use the
smooth surface for a mirror, as they stood
majestic in their garments of white. We rode
along in silence, hour after hour, past the
huge mountains of granite, slate, and sandstone,
with here and there a stringer of
quartz. I could not but wonder what a
force must have been at work to have caused
such an upheaval. Beautiful clusters of pink,
yellow, and purple flowers were clinging to
the perpendicular face of the rocks, and relieved
much of the severity of outline. As
we advanced toward the head of the bay,
the eagles, in their solitude perching here and
there on the topmost pinnacles, eyed us with
suspicion. Now and again one would leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
the cliff, soar round and round overhead
until we passed out of sight, doubtless wondering
what strange creatures these were. We
arrived at the head of the bay about midnight
in this land of twilight, and soon had a good
wood fire alongside a big cottonwood tree,
where with &#8220;spuds&#8221; and flounders, hard
tack and a tin of hot &#8220;Old English Breakfast,&#8221;
we were quite contented. After a corncob
pipe and a short story or two, we threw our
blankets on the beach and were quickly in
the Land of Nod.</p>

<p>The next morning we were up about the
time the sun was casting his rays over the
eastern snow-capped peaks. What a picture
for an artist! If painted true to nature almost
any person would say, &#8220;Overdrawn, overdrawn!&#8221;
yet with the deep blue sky for a
background, the white mountains in bold
relief, pushing their tops into the blue, and
the green foothills and the placid waters of
the bay in the foreground, how could the
scene be overdrawn? In that dawn of morning
the flight of ducks to and from the feeding
grounds was numerous, the most conspicuous
of them all being the harlequin duck (<i>Histrionicus
histrionicus</i>) because of the prominent
black and white stripes. It builds its nest
along the mountain stream which dashes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
tosses down the gorge, and when the young
are hatched leads them to the sea.</p>

<p>Just as soon as we got a bite to eat, with our
rifles and field-glasses we started for our daily
hunt. On our way up the mountain a little
brown body streaked with black fluttered
out from beneath a tuft of grass underneath
the pussy willows. Stooping and separating
the dry grass, we exposed the four whitish
eggs of the white-crowned sparrow (<i>Zonotrichia
leucophrys</i>). In about an hour we saw
a large bear traveling at a rapid gait&mdash;at
times running&mdash;along the mountain just at
the snow-line. We sat down and watched
him through the glasses, hoping he would
soon find a place to his liking to take a little
snooze. After paralleling the entire base
of the mountain he passed behind a small
group of rocks and emerged on the other side
against the snow, where we could see him
very plainly as he turned back toward the
rocks. We were quite sure he had found a
bed that would suit his purpose. We knew
if he once lay down he was more than likely
to stay for a long nap.</p>

<p>In about twenty minutes we started after
Old Bruin in earnest. Into alder and elder
we plunged, plodding along just as fast as
we could, bringing out the perspiration in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
beads on our red faces. The sun was very
hot and our tramp was difficult,&mdash;over rocks,
under limbs, using the toes of our guns
as alpenstocks, we puffed and blew, going
higher and higher. &#8220;Oh, how deceiving!&#8221;
often I thought as we climbed each little
knoll, only to find on arriving at the top that
our objective point was still in the distance.
To be sure, we rested many times before we
reached the place. The uncertainty of the
wind annoyed us greatly, and often the
only way we could tell how it was blowing
was by tossing a few crushed leaves into
the air.</p>

<p>After two hours&#8217; hard work we arrived at
the place best suited for us to get a shot at
Mr. Bear, when he should leave the thickest
of the alder. We maneuvered around the
top a considerable time, found his trail following
a ravine up the mountain, and in this
way he reached the opening of an extinct
crater. At the very time when we were
expecting a shot at any minute, he must have
been on the other side of the mountain.
Wearily we slipped, slid, and tramped our
way down. By the time we reached camp,
hungry and tired, it was well along in the
afternoon. After getting something to eat
we took a couple of hours&#8217; nap, and again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
watched the foothills in the hope of discovering
the object of our search, but in vain.</p>

<p>We had several beautiful days; in fact,
the middle of the day was too hot to hunt
with any comfort. If you had been watching,
you might have seen a solitary pair wending
their way up along the river flat; one tall and
well built in proportion, with a broad-brimmed
western hat on his head, the other small in
stature, with a small slouch hat set on the
back of his head, one carrying a Winchester
and the other an Eastman kodak. If you
had observed closely, you would have noticed
that both hats were constantly turning in a
semicircle from side to side, as the eyes were
busy scanning every direction, expecting that
the quarry would put in an appearance somehow,
somewhere; for we had arrived at the
conclusion that we would have to work harder
in order to get a big specimen of the Kodiak
bear. We followed the river valley for ten
miles without seeing any fresh signs. About
noon we ate our lunch, stretched out in the
warm sun, and slept peacefully for several
hours, then turned towards camp, hunting
on our way back.</p>

<p>Up to this time the bear seemed to live up
on the very tops of the mountains and occasionally
to come down about the snow-line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
and again return. We had several wild-goose
chases after them, only to discover that they
were somewhere else. Now we noticed they
were beginning to feed on the grass and come
down into the valley. The leaves were
pretty well developed by this time. Hunting
big bear in the alder is very dangerous sport,
for at any minute a big she with her cubs
might rise up close by and make a charge.
If our guns should catch in the brush, the
jig would be all up, for the bear are large and
hard to stop at close range. My guide said
that not many men will hunt them in this
way and told me he had had several narrow
escapes himself. On one occasion he dropped
a big fellow right at his feet. They vary in
size; the largest skin in the picture on page 105
measured eleven by nine feet. They also vary
in color from a dark brown to yellow. The
specimens I have seen have a tawny crescent
just back of the neck.</p>

<p>The natives do not hunt the bear by following
them through the brush, and have a
wholesome fear of stalking them afoot. I
have been told that the only way they will
hunt is to follow the coast line in a <i>bidarka</i>,
and when the bear come out to feed on the
fish along some stream they kill them. My
guide, who has had a great deal of experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
with the natives of the peninsula, told me
that he could sell all the bear intestines to
the natives, getting a good price for them.
Out of these intestines they make water-proof
coats, called <i>kamlaykas</i>. In the early
spring they examine the intestines very
carefully. They consider that in bear killed
as soon as they come out of hibernation the
intestines are useless, for they believe the
bear retire to their winter quarters in the fall
gorged with fish. The fish bones perforate
the intestines and it takes several weeks for
them to heal enough to make the best water-proof
coats.</p>

<p>We worked our way up to the snow-line
and hunted until ten o&#8217;clock without getting
a sight of one, although we trailed a large
bear a long way through the grass. They are
great tramps and will travel many miles
without stopping. Where this one crossed
the creek the water was not yet dried on the
leaves when we came up. For four days the
weather was fine and as it was not necessary
to put our tent up, a great deal of time could
be saved in this way.</p>

<p>On our wandering about the island, about
five o&#8217;clock one evening the fishermen&#8217;s camp
was reached and they treated us royally, gave
us a square meal of candle fish, some tobacco,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
sugar and tea, and sent us on our way rejoicing.
We pulled along all day without any incident
of much interest. Once two bald eagles
soared over our heads, and my guide could
not resist the temptation. Up went his rifle
and three times in succession the shot brought
some feathers out of the wings, while the
fourth brought the bird pitching headlong
into the bay. At one point we watched an
eagle in the air with two crows after him. It
was evident the crows had their nest nearby
and the eagle had ventured too near. The
crows seemed to have the best of the fight,
for they would take turns in darting down
on their foe, while the eagle seemed to be
helpless in the air, for the crows would strike
and be away before he could harm them.</p>

<p>Now our thoughts turned homeward, but
we realized that it would take some time to
pull with oars seventy or eighty miles in a
dory to Kodiak. Breaking camp one morning
about two o&#8217;clock, we tried to get out
with the tide, but unfortunately we were
caught on the flats and were forced to spend
six hours until the tide returned. Being
anxious to get home as soon as possible, we
were using every effort to gain time, and
one little experience we had I shall not forget
as long as I live. The wind had been blowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
a gale all day, and about nine o&#8217;clock in the
evening, after making slow progress, we came
to a point which would require us either to
lie by for the balance of the night, then follow
the shore line for about ten miles, or cross
directly over a distance of about three miles
to the other side of the bay. The wind had
died down considerably and was blowing
toward us from the other shore; we were
anxious to cross and discussed the advisability
of trying it, finally deciding that we
could do so safely. With both at the oars,
the dory loaded to within three or four inches
of the water, and the breakers running, we
started across and got along fairly well until
we were about midway over. We naturally
expected the whitecaps would diminish in
size and the wind would be going down, when
to our dismay the wind rose, the waves grew
more boisterous, and about every seventh
wave would toss part of its volume clear over
us. Occasionally I would ship the oars,
grab the tomato can, and bail frantically until
the water was almost all out,&mdash;then to the
oars again to assist in keeping the boat under
control. My companion was skillful in handling
the boat, and while I was bailing out the
craft he had to make desperate efforts to keep
the bow cutting the rollers diagonally; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
gradually the wind seemed to get the boat
out of its safest course, and then I had to take
up the oars and help to right her again. To
say the least, I realized the predicament we
were in. At the time, I had almost given
up the idea of reaching the shore in safety,
and one who has never had a similar experience
cannot understand the feeling of hope that
rose within us as we advanced nearer the
other side.</p>

<p>While we were still battling with wind and
wave, I promised myself that if we reached
safety I would never again risk a similar
experience, and yet on the following day we
pulled the boat fourteen miles across the
mouth of another such bay, with the water
as smooth as glass all the way over. Knowing
the rapidity with which the wind can
rise over those treacherous straits and the
risk we were taking after the experience of
the previous day, neither of us spoke more
than half a dozen words during the entire
time until we landed safely.</p>

<p>Returning at last to Kodiak, we caught a
boat for Valdez, whence we engaged passage
on the homeward cruise. Taking the outside
route from Valdez to Seattle, we experienced
a rough voyage. At the captain&#8217;s table
were seated about a dozen passengers, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
in high spirits in anticipation of reaching home,
and thankful that we had not taken passage
on the <i>Valentia</i>, the preceding steamer, which
was wrecked on the rocks before it got
rightly started. One by one the members of
the party would fail to put in an appearance
on account of seasickness. One day the
captain complimented the author on being
such a good sailor, but in answer I suggested
that he wait a little. I felt it coming on, and
sure enough the captain had the table to
himself at the very next meal.</p>

<p>One night while lying in my bunk I was
aroused from a doze by a shout from the
occupant of the under bunk: &#8220;There&#8217;s a rat
in your bed! There&#8217;s a rat in your bed!&#8221;
I looked out to see my informant standing on
a chair. In a short time we had a light, and
in the bunk we found a Mother Carey&#8217;s chick
that had been attracted by the light on the
boat and entered the room. We caught the
little bird and kept it until morning. It
seemed not to be disturbed by our attentions,
indeed was content to cuddle down in our
hands. Its apparent tameness was probably
due to the fact that its habits are partly
nocturnal.</p>

<p>After three or four stormy days, with the
sea running high and breaking in whitecaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
over the deck, not a thing to be seen save
the sailors and the albatross following in the
wake of the steamer, we reached the port of
Seattle. The vision and the sensation of
the tossing and pitching waters remained
with us, and on landing we found that our
&#8220;sea legs&#8221; made walking on terra firma a
very awkward process.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<br />
HUNTING BIG GAME ON THE KENAI PENINSULA</h2>

<p>We arrived at Seldovia, on Cook&#8217;s Inlet,
on the evening of August 28th. Between
the steamer landing and the town,
a creek, unbridged as yet, enters the bay,
and except at ebb tide the passengers are
compelled to cross the arm of the bay by
rowboat. The tide being then at flood, it
was necessary to get a dory before we could
reach the village. One of the natives who
hailed from the cannery nearby was the proud
owner of an old dugout. We knew the water
was quite shallow across the arm of the fiord,
yet some of the party were fearful of the
craft. We all got into the boat, and how
quickly the inexperienced displayed their
awkwardness. Instead of stepping carefully
to the center they landed on the side, causing
the dugout to ship water. After righting
matters we started across, when &#8220;Clumsy,&#8221;
in trying to make himself comfortable, rocked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
the craft and &#8220;Timid&#8221; gave peremptory commands
to return, which we did. Two of
the party got out and the rest were landed
safely on the other shore. In a few hours we
were all aboard a home-made tug of six tons
burden, called the <i>Bydarky</i>, and on our way
up the inlet some sixty miles to Kenai. We
retired to our bunks shortly after the boat
got under way, and when we awoke in the
morning we were lying at anchor near the
beach at Kenai. The captain of the boat,
being very anxious to get out on the tide,
asked us to unload our duffel as quickly as
possible, so that he might start at once. In
our haste we overlooked Doc&#8217;s hand satchel
but did not discover this until too late.</p>

<p>Kenai is a little village built on a plateau
overlooking the inlet, a sixty-foot sand embankment
down to the water&#8217;s edge, lending
it the appearance of a fortified town. We
ascended the road, entered the post-office and
store, and began to make inquiries about
guides, boats, and equipment. We soon
learned that we could get white guides for
ten dollars per day and &#8220;keep,&#8221; and natives
for five dollars; white packers for five dollars
per day and &#8220;keep,&#8221; natives for three dollars.
After scouring the village we found two
licensed native guides and two packers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
gave them instructions to get our boats and
provisions ready as quickly as possible, so
that we could leave on the next flood tide
for the Kenai River. In selecting guides and
packers, I think it is a mistake to take natives,
as they are naturally indolent, lack the
interest the white man has in his work, are
over-sensitive about their treatment, and sulk
upon the least provocation; and then one
never can impress upon them the eagerness
of the party to secure, in the limited time at
its disposal, photographs of big game in its
natural haunts, or a desirable trophy. Time
is the only object to them when they are
out with a party at five dollars a day. To
illustrate, on this occasion we had made an
agreement with the head guide that the
packers would go with us for three dollars
a day and &#8220;keep,&#8221; but we were not out more
than a three days&#8217; &#8220;line&#8221; of the river until
they demanded three fifty, and when refused
began to sulk and lag behind with their work,
and for fear they would leave us before we
got up the river we were obliged to grant
their demand. Indeed, they will sometimes
purposely lead parties away from the best
game country in order to keep them out as
long as possible.</p>

<p>The evening before we arrived at Kenai,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
two miners had come to town for provisions
and had sold their dust. They then started
out for a good time, landed in a &#8220;joint,&#8221;
consumed all the &#8220;houch,&#8221; after which they
proceeded to &#8220;paint the town red.&#8221; They
succeeded fairly well, ended up with broken
heads and limbs, and with a bullet in the
breast of one. In the village was a doctor,
some eighty years of age, who had long been
in the habit of locating for the summer at
Kenai to practice medicine. When the old
man learned that there was a doctor in our
party he looked us up and invited a consultation.
Doc accepted the invitation, and
on examination found the lead had entered
the side, glanced around the ribs, and embedded
itself in the muscles. He was very much
surprised to find that the patient was wrapped
in an extremely dirty towel, and everything
was filthy. He said to the local physician,
&#8220;Are you not afraid of the wound becoming
infected?&#8221; Whereupon the latter informed
him that no pus ever formed in wounds in
that country and that infection was unknown.
Our doctor made considerable inquiry about
the matter, for he was very much interested,
and learned that this was true.</p>

<p>The man who did the shooting was arrested
and placed in the custody of the town bailiff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
but was permitted to roam over the country
at will. The authorities well know, and so
do the prisoners, that it would be suicide of
the worst form for the guilty to try to escape
to the woods, for it means death of the most
horrible sort&mdash;by exposure and starvation.
The only avenue of escape was by boat that
left twice a week. Inquiring about the case
on our return trip, we learned that the commissioner
had arrived, a day was fixed for
hearing, the testimony was beyond a doubt
conclusive against the prisoner, and he was
held without bail for trial at Valdez, whither
he was taken by the commissioner. However,
the injured man recovered and the
gallows was again defrauded.</p>

<p>Our party consisted of four, and for brevity&#8217;s
sake we will call them &#8220;Doc,&#8221; &#8220;Old
Sourdough,&#8221; &#8220;Cheechalker,&#8221; and &#8220;Esau.&#8221;
The provisions had all been purchased at
Seattle and packed carefully in water-proof
bags and cans. Many and varied were the
suggestions made by the party as to what
should be taken along. Doc suggested talcum
powder, frostilene, and vaseline, with
pills of various colors, red, white, and blue.
He had a special satchel well filled with antiseptics,
anodynes, astringents, styptics, and
bactericides, but unfortunately for his peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
of mind he discovered, too late, that the
precious satchel had been left on the <i>Bydarky</i>,
the little boat that brought us over
from Seldovia to Kenai, and there were
no immediate prospects of recovering the
important parcel. Doc looked wistfully
after the little boat disappearing in the
distance as it plowed its way through the
tide-rifts, and submitted with such grace
as he could command to the chaffing of his
companions.</p>

<p>By way of firearms Cheechalker (northern
name for &#8220;tenderfoot&#8221;) had quite an assortment,&mdash;a
ten-gauge shotgun with five hundred
rounds of ammunition, one Springfield army
rifle, model of 1909, a Winchester .30-.30, and
several others. Cheechalker insisted upon his
tin bathtub, but Old Sourdough finally pacified
him with a description of a bath <i>à la Wilderness</i>.
This is accomplished by erecting a
tepee, like that the Indians build, around a
fire in a small depression filled with stones,
then, when the bather is ready, removing the
fire and pouring water on the stones, thus
producing steam enough to open the pores of
the skin, after which a good rubbing at the
hands of an Indian valet completes the ablution.
In this way one might get along for
a few weeks at least without his tub. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a><br /><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>this substitute Cheechalker finally consented
to give up the useful article.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="F_65" name="F_65"></a>
<img src="images/image129.jpg" width="500" height="291" alt="Kenai River" title="Kenai River" />
<span class="caption">Kenai River</span>
</div>

<p>Esau carefully selected a prospector&#8217;s pick,
gold pan, and shovel to do a little prospecting
on the side. In his telescope he had his toothbrush,
comb, hair-brush, manicure set, etc.,
which he considered absolutely necessary
for his personal comfort. He also carried his
own knife and fork, tin cup, and tin plate,
each artistically marked with his own symbol.</p>

<p>Old Sourdough watched these arrangements
with an expression of disgust. He
carried a red bandanna handkerchief dangling
from his belt, containing his change of socks,
some smoking tobacco, and matches. Later
he improvised a very serviceable pipe by
fitting a shot cartridge shell with a split
willow stem, artistically wrapped with thread.</p>

<p>After the packing was completed we embarked
upon the Kenai River in two twenty-foot
dories, with the tide in our favor. The
river meandered like a wriggling snake for
about a mile through the marshy flats; beyond,
the shore was lined to the water&#8217;s edge with
cottonwood, birch, and spruce. On our way,
ducks, geese, and many other water-fowl were
flushed by the noise of the oars in the locks
and the splash of the blades as they dipped
into the water. The guides were making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
all haste, being anxious to get as far up the
river as possible, knowing it was no mean
task to pull, line, and pole the mile or more
to the head of tide water without the aid
of full tide.</p>

<p>When we reached our first camp the flies
and mosquitoes were very plentiful. The
boys were loud in their forceful expressions
against the songsters and their near cousins,
the black flies. All hands were busy, some
erecting the tents, others cutting spruce
boughs for a good bed, and the rest getting
something to eat for the hungry party.</p>

<p>Pitching camp very quickly developed the
inexperience of Cheechalker. Always willing
to lend a helping hand, he started the fire on
the windward side, filling our eyes with smoke.
The site he selected for the tent showed plenty
of roots, well calculated to furnish an uneasy
experience for the night. When he pointed
it out to us, we soon overruled him. The
duffel was hardly unloaded until Doc was
ransacking the outfit for his .22 rifle to shoot
some Canada grouse (<i>Dendragapus canadensis</i>).
They are very plentiful in the spruce
timber and when flushed will fly to a limb,
where they sit and crane their necks at the
hunter, who, if he is wise enough to pick off
the lowest bird at each shot, may, if he so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
desires, clean out the entire covey. In the
meantime one of the party had shot a red
squirrel, and at the suggestion of Old Sourdough
it was nailed to the limb of a tree in
anticipation of a little fun at Doc&#8217;s expense.
On his return the old Indian said in his guttural
voice (pointing at the squirrel), &#8220;Look! look!
him big squirrel, shoot!!&#8221; Old Sourdough,
meanwhile helping the fun along by craning
his neck in every direction, said, &#8220;Where?
where?&#8221; In the meantime Doc was making a
mad rush for his .35 Winchester; crack went
the gun, off went the ears of Mr. Squirrel,
and he gently swayed on the nail; once more
the gun cracked, and this time the body fell
to the ground in fragments. Then the woods
rang again and again with the shouts of the
party, while Doc threatened dire vengeance
on those who perpetrated the joke.</p>

<p>After dinner, a smoke, and a few stories, the
Indians departed to their tent and we all
stretched out in a row for our night&#8217;s sleep.
But too soon, for one fellow pulled the blanket
from his neighbor. Then there was a &#8220;rough
house,&#8221; and after that duels to the death with
mosquitoes, all punctuated with such a variety
of exclamations that the vocabulary of each
was exhausted before quiet was restored.</p>

<img src="images/image133.jpg" width="500" height="271" alt="Lining the Boat" title="Lining the Boat" />
<span class="caption">Lining the Boat</span>
</div>

<p>On the way out next morning the hunters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a><br /><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>were boasting about the number of fine
trophies they were going to take home, for
all reports indicated plenty of sheep and
moose. About that time one of the party
remembered we had forgotten to bring salt
along for curing the &#8220;fine trophies;&#8221; then
a call was sent out for a meeting to discuss
ways and means to procure the necessary
salt. At the caucus it was decided to send the
packers back to Kenai with a boat, and a halt
was called until the following day, when the
return of the packers was expected. They
arrived in good time with a bushel of coarse
salt.</p>

<p>Kenai River is very swift and cannot be
ascended in a dory pulled with oars, so the
boat must be &#8220;lined&#8221; along the shore. There
is no beach along the river and the shore
is almost impassable by foot on account of
trees growing at every conceivable angle and
hanging over and under the water.</p>

<p>In the morning we started, two natives
and two hunters to a boat, the leader with
his two-hundred-foot line well in advance,
carefully keeping the rope on the river side
of all obstructions. Doc selected the position
of captain (steersman) of one of the dories.
Cheechalker took hold of the rope, but before
long he was panting for breath, being quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
fleshy and tipping the scales at two hundred
pounds. He soon found that carrying his
weight on the many ups and downs over
fallen timbers, with the washouts along the
bank and the alder growing thick at places
along the shore, was not a joy ride over a
macadamized road in an auto, nor was it
conducive to easy respiration. The advantage
a man of experience has over the inexperienced
individual, in making his way
over and under logs and overcoming other
difficulties with the least resistance, is wonderful.
For instance, experience has taught the
veteran that he must not step on a slanting
stick, a slime-covered stone, or grass concealing
a washout in the bank. He likewise learns
to avoid many other little indiscretions that
cause heavy falls and bruising of the limbs
and body, which will wear out the vitality
of the strongest. Before long Cheechalker,
who had had several tumbles into the water,
had to have assistance to get out. He was
soon lagging behind, and ere the first lap of
the journey was completed he was begging
us to let him get into the boat. Travel was
delayed long enough for him to don dry
clothing, and when we started he refused to
walk any more, saying it was out of the
question,&mdash;he was completely &#8220;tuckered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
out.&#8221; It was then that one of the natives
hesitated for some time before he would
consent to go on, for it required all the red
men&#8217;s strength and skill on the line to get the
boat along without this additional load of two
hundred pounds. Cheechalker, with his red
face, looked for all the world like a lobster,
so Old Sourdough took pity on him and had
a heart-to-heart talk with the natives. His
argument was, &#8220;Him sick, heap sick,&mdash;like
turtle, no walk!&#8221; This and similar logic was
used for a period of about five minutes,
whereupon the two natives looked at each
other, emitted a few grunts, and started up
the river.</p>

<p>At the end of the first day&#8217;s work we had
made about eight miles and built our camp-fire
for the night. Nothing unusual happened
that evening, but the inevitable &#8220;no-see-ims&#8221;
and mosquitoes had sufficient time to
gather and kept us busy moving at short
intervals from place to place, following the
smudge smoke. Cheechalker, although naturally
sluggish on account of his avoirdupois,
was quite active now, first to windward
and then to leeward of the smudge, between
periods of relief from smoke and &#8220;no-see-ims.&#8221;
Doc complained at frequent intervals
about the &#8220;pesky critters,&#8221; donned his veil,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a><br /><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>and with hands in his pockets strutted around,
restless and impatient.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">Mid-day on the Kenai</span>
</div>

<p>Old Sourdough, without any modern frills,
sat quietly smoking his makeshift pipe, evidently
enjoying his smoke, but occasionally
disturbed and raising his hand to chase an
importunate pest out of his eye or ear.</p>

<p>A fallen spruce furnished boughs for a
temporary bed for the tired campers after
a day&#8217;s lining, pulling, and wading. Each
man opened his pack, spread his rubber
blanket on the boughs, and one long tarpaulin
was laid over all. Then each one lay down
wrapped in his blanket, and another tarpaulin
was drawn over all four in a row. Thus
settled, we enjoyed the sweet but restless sleep
of the weary. Toward morning when the ice
was forming on the water in the camp pails,
there was a tug of war going on most of the
time between the two end men for the control
of the upper canvas, and as the middle man
expressed it later, &#8220;it had made three round
trips during the night,&#8221; for he felt it &#8220;sawing
its way across&#8221; under his nose.</p>

<p>Ever to our ears through the night came
the roar of the river, here two hundred yards
wide, rushing day and night to the sea, grand
and powerful, glistening here and there in
the morning twilight as the raging waters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
boiled and seethed over the hidden bowlders
that threw the water as though some huge
monster were trying to &#8220;buck&#8221; the current.</p>

<p>As soon as breakfast was over every man
went to his task, the blankets were rolled
in separate bundles, the entire equipment
packed carefully, the guns tied fast for fear
of the boat capsizing in the strong current.
The leader started with the rope, two others
followed, each taking a hold in turn, and the
captain steered. The leader in advance put
the rope on the river side of all trees, rocks,
and debris; the other two, climbing out on the
trees that extended over the water, assisted in
pulling and keeping the rope clear. Occasionally
we struck rapids, where the current was
swift and caused much trouble to the boats
by driving one or the other against a hidden
bowlder, where it would hang as on a pivot,
swinging backward and forward until one of
the Indians would wade out in the ice-cold
water up to his waist and release it.</p>

<p>The mania to kill was very strong in the
hunters and at dawn the most bloodthirsty
was astir, exhorting the cook to build a fire
in the Yukon stove and hustling the packers
to get ready for our up-river trip by loading
the boats with the duffel. Across the beautiful
river, sparkling with the silt of the glaciers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
aglow with the morning sun, stood a solitary,
snow-white herring gull, breakfasting upon
a king salmon that had been cast by the
swift current into an eddy and gently washed
ashore. The passion for wilful destruction
was uppermost in the heart of the gunner,
and as quickly as possible he had a leaden
missile on its way across the water. With
the field-glasses could be seen the white bird
with its graceful wings spread helplessly over
the water and the beautiful white feathers
crimsoned with its life blood, slowly moving
with the current to the sea.</p>

<p>In a short time stakes were pulled, duffel
packed, lines adjusted, and we were on our
way. There was a little commotion at the
head of the line when Simeon, one of the
Indians, spied a large porcupine plodding
his way deeper into the forest. Letting go
of the rope he made a rush for the &#8220;porky,&#8221;
caught it by the tail, held on till he got a
club nearby, and proceeded to pound it over
the head. The natives are very fond of
&#8220;porky,&#8221; and when we pitched camp in the
evening Simeon was very busy singeing the
hair over the fire before boiling.</p>

<span class="caption">&#8220;Porky&#8221;</span>
</div>

<p>On our way up the river we were agreeably
surprised to see a stranger walk into camp.
Tall, erect, with clean-cut features, he looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the very picture of health. He wore a broad-brimmed
hat with the garb of a hunter.
Lunch was about ready, and on invitation
he dined with us. In conversation we soon
learned that he was a college man, a graduate
of one of the leading colleges in the East, and
had come from our own eastern city some
fourteen years before. He told us that for several
years he had corresponded with relatives
and friends, but finally quit writing because
he had not yet made his stake. However,
he now had many encouraging prospects,
and before long expected to make good and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
return east. It was surprising to us how an
educated man could spend fourteen of the
best years of his life in his little tent, with
mosquitoes and &#8220;no-see-ims&#8221; as his only
companions, dreaming, dreaming of the find
that never came, and with his pan, pick, and
shovel digging every here and there, with
color, color everywhere, but not in paying
quantities. On our way down we found him
as usual, dreaming of the prospects he had
staked, and when we left him a sack of flour
and a few other necessaries of life he was very
grateful, showing that a warm heart beat
beneath the rough exterior. We bid him
good-bye, and a large tear coursed down his
cheek as he said: &#8220;I wish I were going with
you, boys; but not yet; soon, I hope.&#8221; Is
it any wonder that the steamers on their
return trips carry so many insane men to the
States? The entire river has been prospected
and staked; the blazed trees and
indelible pencil marks are about the only
method of indicating that a claim has been
staked. About half-way up the river we
came to the deserted tent of the fellows who
had participated in the shooting at Kenai.</p>

<p>In order to have a pleasant time on a trip
of this sort it is very essential to have companions
accustomed to &#8220;roughing it.&#8221; Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
man in the party must sacrifice individual
comfort for the benefit of the camp as a whole.
I have in mind a trip taken to Alaska with
another party where one individual was so
selfish that every action was for his own
comfort and enjoyment. For instance, he
was always first to eat and managed to get
a double portion of everything, cooked and
uncooked. If there was one duck, one grouse,
or one trout, he managed to cook the one and
gorge himself and eat all to his own satisfaction.
In the morning he was always first
up and ready for breakfast, taking care of
his individual interests and paying no attention
to others. In fact, he would even
permit the destruction of goods not his own
without showing the least interest. In the
same party was another character in many
ways the opposite, always last to the table
and never looking out for his own things;
going around growling about this, that, and
the other thing,&mdash;never in time for breakfast,
lunch, or supper. There is no better opportunity
to find out the good qualities of a
companion than to go camping with him in
the wilds. A selfish disposition soon becomes
unbearable, and many a good outing has
been spoiled by having such a fellow in the
party. Few men are so constituted that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
can stand &#8220;roughing it&#8221; very long under
trying circumstances without showing the
&#8220;yellow streak.&#8221;</p>

<p>After seven days&#8217; hard work we reached
Lake Skilak. The sun was just setting,
casting a mellow crimson reflection over
the placid waters. The beautiful lake was
hemmed in on all sides by verdured slopes
and snow-capped peaks, the dark green of
the spruce intermingling with patches of
cottonwood clothed in autumnal colors, &#8220;the
sear, the yellow leaf&#8221; predominating. On
the surface of the water, idling away the
time, were little flocks of ducks, and in the
air were black cormorants heavy in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
flight. This serene panorama filled the nature-lovers
in the party with joy and delight,
and they felt themselves well repaid for all
the hardship of the week. The Indians
wanted to make camp at once, and showed
their displeasure when they learned that we
desired to take advantage of a strong fair
wind and hoist our sail regardless of their
wishes. We made elegant time to an island,
on which we camped for the night. The
next day we reached the head of the lake,
where we expected to spend several weeks.</p>

<p>The party had decided to make a try after
white sheep on the mountain beyond the
divide. By this time Cheechalker had had
enough of tramping and quietly informed
us that we might count him out; he was
perfectly satisfied, he said, to remain with
the cook at the permanent camp. This was
located at the mouth of a little stream which
entered the lake after a precipitous course
from the glacier at the summit, down the
mountain canyon, through the narrow gulch
of the upper foothills to the wooded valley,
chasing and tumbling under and over moss-grown
and decayed trees, fallen giants of
other years. The under foliage had been
destroyed by a fire which was still smoldering
here and there among the moss, and the sun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
entering the opening between the trees,
shimmered and fluttered on the spray-moistened
bowlders like fantastic rays of Aladdin&#8217;s
lamp. Here we pitched our tent among the
stately birches, intending to make this our
headquarters for some time.</p>

<p>Taking a stroll a little way up the beach
we were agreeably surprised to find we had
neighbors, and were interested to know who
they were and what they were doing. One
suggested prospectors, another hunters; in
the meantime, while we were looking at their
outfit for a suggestion, a collection of stones
in the niche of a tree, the skull of a rodent,
an insect or two, answered the question beyond
the shadow of a doubt,&mdash;a naturalist
in pursuit of data that the world might be
benefited by his researches. The following
day his packer came into camp with a beautiful
specimen of Dall&#8217;s sheep (<i>Ovis dalli nelson</i>).
We then learned that it was Mr. Bell, from
the University of Minneapolis.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<img src="images/image147.jpg" width="500" height="287" alt="Ready for the Start" title="Ready for the Start" />
<span class="caption">Ready for the Start</span>
</div>

<p>We left camp for the top of the mountain,
every man with his pack. The tramp along
the trail was interesting, leading as it did
through spruce, birch, and cottonwood until
we reached the end, where we were obliged
to push through low alder and &#8220;devil&#8217;s clubs.&#8221;
The latter average about one inch in thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a><br /><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>ness,
and in this locality grow as high as a
man&#8217;s head. They are usually straight and
branchless, of a yellowish-green color, and are
thickly covered with slender sharp spines
that readily penetrate the clothing and cause
great discomfort to one who undertakes to
pass through a thicket.</p>

<p>The ascent was very steep from this point
until we reached the altitude of &#8220;little sticks.&#8221;
One of the Nimrods was in advance a short
distance, and so anxious was he to reach the
sheep country that he went off the trail and
had to be recalled. But his aggressiveness
was short-lived, and long before midday he
was shouting at the top of his voice from the
rear end of the string of packs, &#8220;Wait! Wait!
You&#8217;re going too d&mdash;&mdash; fast!&#8221; In a short time
we ran into a bees&#8217; nest, and you should have
seen the party scatter to get out of raiding
distance of the nest, every man for himself,
packs bouncing, hats waving, all shouting
until we reached a safe distance.</p>

<span class="caption">Approaching the Low Pass</span>
</div>

<p>As we ascended the mountain the mosquitoes
grew scarcer and scarcer. About the
&#8220;land of little sticks&#8221; we stopped for a light
lunch. Looking in the direction indicated
by the guide we saw a large moose feeding
in a little swale. Doc could not see him, try
as he would. The Indian endeavored to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a><br /><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>assist him by locating the animal with reference
to a good-sized rock, but his untrained
eye, even with the aid of field-glasses, could
not make out the outline and we had to give
up in despair, although he was very keen to
see it. Blueberries were quite plentiful all
around us and after we ate our lunch we filled
up with them as a dessert. We came to a
little pond of crystal water at the foot of a
small glacier, and as soon as we reached the
margin some twenty-five or thirty ptarmigan
took flight in all directions. They were still
in their moulting plumage. By this time
the largest man in the party was unable to
keep the pace, and lagging behind kept the
entire party back. In starting up the canyon
the ambitious member turned up the right
side, but erelong came to a place that was
impassable and began to shout, &#8220;I can&#8217;t go
any farther along here.&#8221; One of the others
answered, &#8220;Slide, slide!&#8221; and the mighty
Nimrod took the suggestion and slid down the
shale to the bottom and then began the ascent
from another point on the opposite side,
where he found traveling much easier. This
is the common experience of the over-zealous
tenderfoot.</p>

<span class="caption">Home of the White Sheep</span>
</div>

<p>There was a low pass over the mountain
and we had to wind our way up, down, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
around in order to make it, for it was only
accessible by way of an almost perpendicular
rock. The leaders reached the top and were
required to wait for the rear-guard, but the
tail end, before he could get up, had to have
the assistance of a rope tied around his body.
What with pulling and tugging by the guides
on the upper end of the rope, the big fellow
was gently and carefully landed in safety.
When he reached us he was puffing and blowing
like a wind-broken horse and insisted we
must camp right there, for he could go no
farther. And although we had intended to
reach the valley some five miles beyond,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
where we could get wood and water, we were
forced, out of sympathy for a big-hearted,
congenial companion, to camp just where
we were, he being completely tired out from
his trying experience.</p>

<p>After a restless night, with visions of sheep
and photographs galore, we were up and
ready to start about the time the ptarmigan
were clucking their announcement of the
rosy dawn. The country was cut into gently-sloping
valleys clothed with verdure, between
long ridges of mountains partly covered with
snow. Through the glasses a dozen or more
white specks on the mountain-side could be
distinguished as sheep moving slowly as they
grazed. We were too far away to tell whether
there were any big rams in the flock.</p>

<p>Considering the topographical conditions,
the wind and the method of approach, we
mapped out our <i>modus operandi</i> and started
up the ridge of the mountain on the right.
It was a long, hard pull and by the time we
reached the summit all were wearied, especially
my companion, who kept shouting a
request not to go so fast. Several hours
after we spied the sheep we were crawling
stealthily over the backbone of the ridge
where we expected to find the flock, but
were sadly disappointed. The photographer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
threw his kodak back into the case with a
quiet &#8220;d&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;; the other pushed his &#8220;safety&#8221;
on, threw his gun over his shoulder, and turned
back with a shaking of the head that was
more expressive than language. After examining
carefully every likely place, all that
we could find of the flock was one lonely
little lamb looking at us as though in disgust.
Presently it went away down into the valley
and we watched it as it ascended the opposite
side and disappeared as a little speck over
the divide.</p>

<p>When we left camp in the morning the
tenderfoot was still in bed and on our return
we were surprised to see how happy he was.
Pointing to the carcass of a little lamb, and
beating his breast with his good right hand,
he said: &#8220;I&#8217;ve got my sheep. No more
tramping those d&mdash;&mdash; mountains for me. I&#8217;m
going back to camp.&#8221; We were very much
disgusted to think he would travel six thousand
miles and spend so much money to hunt
one half-day and then turn &#8220;quitter.&#8221; We
used every argument in our power and as
tactfully as possible tried to persuade him
not to turn back, but of no avail. Turning
to us he retorted: &#8220;You old Sourdoughs, I
wouldn&#8217;t follow you over those mountains
for ten thousand dollars.&#8221; So with a packer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
he started around the mountain towards
camp, happy as a lark, promising us he would
send the packer back with flour and other
provisions. Little did we suspect that he
would try to starve us out of the camp and
thereby force us to return to headquarters.</p>

<p>According to prearranged plan, we intended
to move down the valley and select a camp
site where we could get wood. About the
time we started the wind blew a gale, bringing
rain and sleet. For four hours we tramped
through the wet underbrush with the elements
pelting and lashing us in their fury. We were
drenched to the skin. As soon as our camp
site was selected, we threw off our packs in a
drizzling rain and each man turned to his
task. Two arranged the canvas under a
spreading scrub hemlock, for we needed the
protection from the wind. Soon a huge fire
was going, dispensing its cheerful warmth
through the gloom, driving away the blues
of my companion, who was beginning to
complain a great deal. Disrobing, we hung
our wet clothing over the surrounding limbs,
where it was soon steaming away, while the
hunters were toasting their shins as they
waited for dry clothes and liquid refreshment,
for by this time the teapot was trying to
quench the little side fire and the sizzling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
lamb chops were about done to a finish.
After a while my friend began to thaw out;
turning to me, he said: &#8220;Billy, I wonder what
our friends would say if they saw us now.
I have no doubt they would suggest a committee
of the person,&#8221; and I answered: &#8220;But
this is only one side of it. We enjoy life by
contrast. When we get into our dry clothing,
how we will enjoy it, and when the sun shines
to-morrow, how it will fill our hearts with
gladness! Every thorn has its rose, the
darkest cloud its silver lining.&#8221;</p>

<span class="caption">Seeking a Ford</span>
</div>

<p>After a good night&#8217;s rest and something
to eat, we divided into two parties. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
companion and his guide going toward the
north, I started westward up Benjamin Creek
with the intention of crossing, but the current
was so swift that it was impossible to find a
ford. Although the guide, with me on his
back, waded into the ice-cold water several
times, he was forced to return for fear of being
carried off his feet. On the opposite side
of the creek could be seen a great many sheep,
some feeding, others lying down on rocky
points from which they could command a
good view of the surrounding valley. They
are very quick to distinguish any strange
object a long way off, and before you can
get at all near they take to the summit and
disappear beyond. In the flock there was
not a single head that could be considered a
trophy worthy of the chase, even to a tenderfoot.
I am sorry I did not have a telephoto
lens, for I could have secured a fairly
good picture of the group. My friend, George
Shiras, III., got many good pictures in this
same location with a telephoto lens.</p>

<p>In ecstasy I followed the stream, reveling
in the solitude of the rocky fastnesses, where
the right of eminent domain is granted by
the Creator to none save the cloven-hoofed
creatures who have roamed there unmolested
from time immemorial. But now they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
being taught a new lesson. The modern gun
in hands controlled by steady nerves and
unerring eye sounds the death knell of the
species, unless they are given protection.
They are learning slowly and by bitter experience
that even at any distance they are in
imminent danger from the rifle.</p>

<p>Away yonder on the uppermost crag stood
His Majesty, as though chiseled out of and
forming a part of the very rock itself. A
little below stood his companion, another
big ram. Selecting the lower sheep for a
trophy, I elevated the sights for six hundred
yards. I instructed the guide to watch with
the field-glasses where the lead struck the
rock. A loud report, a great recoil, and a
thud carried the message of danger to the
curious, though unsuspecting, sheep. The
guide said, &#8220;A little too high.&#8221; In the
meantime the rams were nervous and undecided
what to do, seeming uncertain as to the
exact location of the enemy. Another thud
on the rocks, this time below, and then away
they went out of sight over the crest. We
did not see them again, and they offered the
only desirable trophies of their kind that we
found on the trip. In the fall the big rams
roam together a great deal in the most
remote and inaccessible places, the ewes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
generally flocking by themselves. It seems
to be the popular belief in that country that
the large rams separate from the flocks and
withdraw by themselves at that season. We
saw several flocks, an average of seventy-five
sheep a day, but there were no big rams
among them.</p>

<p>Our attention is attracted by a movement
on the ground, a glimpse of a marmot, as,
making a bolt along its well-worn path, it
disappears into a hole, reappears, and again
disappears,&mdash;a caper which is characteristic
of the little animal, as though he were curious
to know something definite about the invaders
of his domain. This habit frequently gives
the hunter a shot, but their tenacity of life
is so great that they usually get back into
the hole and one seldom recovers the body.
Their flesh is quite a delicacy among the
natives, as well as to the hunter when hungry.
He is conscious of their presence at all times,
for their whistling can be heard continually
in every direction.</p>

<p>The ptarmigan are plentiful, some partly
concealed among the rocks, and some walking
about craning their necks, all beautiful in
their moulting plumage. Each is in a different
stage of transformation from the handsome
brown of summer to the more beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
winter dress of snow-white. How wonderful
are the ways of the Creator for the preservation
of the species! If the summer plumage
were to remain until the whole land is covered
with snow, how easy it would be for the
ptarmigan hawk, occasionally seen soaring
in the air, to distinguish the bird, make a
dart, pick it up for his evening meal&mdash;and
thus bring about the speedy extermination
of this beautiful species! They are so tame
you could kill with stones all you would eat.
The manner in which nature provides protection
for the inhabitants of the snow peaks
is illustrated again in the case of the sheep,
which are white.</p>

<p>We saw many beautiful little flowers, the
bluebell always in evidence, daisies, a bunch
of forget-me-nots, and what fascinated me
beyond description,&mdash;several bunches of violets
away above the snow-line. They took
me back to the springtime in the Middle
States. The wild geraniums were in bloom,
varying in color from a delicate purple to a
faded hue, with leaves colored from green to
scarlet.</p>

<p>When we left the main camp provisions
enough to last two days were packed. It
was our intention to keep a packer going
between camps carrying our supplies; thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
we could move from place to place as light
as possible. When Doc returned from the
last camp to headquarters with his lamb and
a packer to show him the way, he promised
faithfully to send the Indian back to us with
a good supply of provisions. We suggested
writing down the articles desired, but he
thought this was not necessary,&mdash;that a good
supply would be forthcoming. Thus we separated.
My companion was uneasy for fear
of the Indian not being able to find our camp,
for our supplies were getting low. I had no
fear from this source, knowing well the
natural instinct of a child of the forest for
taking our trail, which was so pronounced
that even a novice could follow us. You
may imagine the chagrin of the party when
he returned on the following day with no
flour and only bread enough to last one meal.
We then came to the conclusion that Doc
was tired of the hunt and had adopted this
means of forcing us by starvation to return
to the provision camp. We hunted all that
day with only one small biscuit apiece. It
was raining, and in the evening, when we
returned to camp wet and hungry, a large
fire was built and our wet clothing dried.
A tin cup full of boiling hot tea soon revived
our depressed spirits. This, with a few ptar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>migan
roasted on a spit, enabled us to retire
in good condition.</p>

<p>By this time my comrade could not stand
the hardships any longer and wanted to
return to the lake. He insisted that there
were no big trophies in the country. I
succeeded in getting him to stay a day or
two longer by telling him I had seen a large
ram. The last day we hunted together we
came upon a prospector&#8217;s cache. On top of
a large stone we noticed a pile of small stones
arranged in a way that at first sight indicated
the hand of man. Examining the pile we
found beans, flour, and dried fruits. Although
we had been living on porcupine for two days,
the natives refused to touch the cache. There
is an unwritten law among prospectors and
hunters that is never violated in this far-away
land. The cache is never disturbed,
for they know full well that some fellow-man
is depending upon the provisions to reach
civilization, and to disturb it may cost the
life of the owner. However, if one in a
starving condition helps himself, he leaves
his name and the owner considers it an act
of humanity. Those only who have been
in a similar situation can appreciate what
it means. One of the guides insisted it was
cached by the owner, who had gone back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
civilization and left it in the hope that some
person in great need might find it. How we
longed to have a mess of those navy beans,
but we had not yet reached the condition
where we could help ourselves, for we were
only one day&#8217;s march from plenty.</p>

<p>Finally my companion had his way, and
in the morning, though the weather looked
threatening, we started, two of the packers
towards camp with the outfit, and the hunters
for the summit once more. While resting
a little before we made the ascent of a high
mountain, my guide pointed out a large
moose, with huge palmated horns. He was
feeding peacefully in the distance, occasionally
looking around as though always on the alert
for foes. One horn was still in the velvet,
and on the other the velvet was dangling
down just ready to drop off, with the red
corpuscles on the antlers glittering in the
rain.</p>

<p>By and by the clouds began to form on
the mountain-tops, and gradually lowered
until they enveloped the entire mountains
and valleys. Again the rain commenced, and
continued a steady downpour for the remainder
of the day. The fates were against
us in respect to the weather, but we did not
have to go hungry, for the marmots were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
plentiful, whistling here and there, as though
a kind Providence had provided a good supper
for the camp. After walking all day in a
cold, drizzling rain that was almost sleet,
we overtook our packers, who had been traveling
since morning in order to reach a
camping place where there were both wood
and water. We finally reached the foothills,
where we found water and scrub spruce
in abundance. One of the guides, while
&#8220;rustling&#8221; sticks for fire, ran onto a large
porcupine, and between marmot soup and
porcupine roast we had an abundance to
satisfy the inner man.</p>

<p>After the Indians had eaten their fill,&mdash;and
the amount they could eat was surprising,&mdash;the
one that got the brisket had picked it clean
and started to twirl it in the air, uttering some
chanting words each time he tossed it, until
it fell with the narrow side up, then he turned
to his companions laughing and shaking his
head. Then another went through the same
motions. I subsequently learned that if the
narrow side turned up frequently this indicated
they would have another &#8220;porky&#8221;
on the morrow. Porcupine they prefer to
any other kind of meat. The intestines seem
to be considered the choice morsels. Our
guide would take hold of the intestine with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
one hand and with the other would strip it
of its contents in the various stages of digestion.
Then to each man would be allotted
his <i>pro rata</i> share,&mdash;and each was careful
to see that he got his full portion of the delicacy.
Next they would string the sections
on sticks and gather round the fire on their
&#8220;hunkers,&#8221; singeing the tidbits more or less,
each according to his taste. Upon our inquiring
why they did not wash the dainties,
they explained that washing spoiled the
flavor. There was a great deal of humor
about them and they frequently tried to play
simple jokes on each other. Occasionally
one would reach for the field-glasses, look
long and earnestly, then point in the direction
of the mountain to some rocks and
shout &#8220;Mushee&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> (meaning &#8220;Sheep&#8221;), and
when another member of the party would
hurriedly reach for the glasses and shout
&#8220;No mushee,&#8221; all would have a laugh at his
expense. They are great tea drinkers and
when in camp the teapot is always on the
fire getting hot for the next cup. If for any
reason they were compelled to do without
it, they would sulk until they got it.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The term for mountain sheep in the language of the British
Columbian Indians is &#8220;Scoulaps.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>It rained all night and we did not rest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>well, although very tired after our trip over
long stretches of mountain-side covered with
loose stones of all sizes and forms thrown
down by the elements from the mountain-top.
The bed was hard; the tent was pitched
under a scrub hemlock to get protection
from the strong wind that was blowing down
the pass. The wind moaned and groaned
all the fore part of the night, then subsided,
but the rain continued till morning. The
Nimrods huddled together in a small depression
on the ground, with no bed but the
rubber blankets and very scanty covering.
Our hip bones would get sore, and one
would turn and then the other, continually.
We were glad to see the dawn of another
day. All night long, &#8220;drip, drip, drip&#8221; in
different parts of the tent the rain could be
heard. The hunting shoe of my companion,
standing upright under one of the largest
leaks, proved an opportune receptacle, consequently
in the morning his shoe was about
half full of rain water. After a breakfast
of porcupine stewed with a spoonful of
evaporated potatoes and washed down with
a cup of tea, we folded our tent and plodded
our weary way towards camp. Blueberries
and salmon-berries were very plentiful. We
found at the higher elevations an abundance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
of a species of blueberry, the woody plants
of which grew less than three inches in height.
They were laden with a small berry, very
sweet to the taste, and so plentiful that they
could be stripped off by the handful. Among
them grew another species as heavily laden
with red fruit, which I think was a species
of partridge-berry. The two grew about the
same height. The Indians preferred the red
berries and seemed fond of them. As for
myself, I was not partial to them, but ate
liberally of the blue.</p>

<p>Among the berries we came upon a covey
of ptarmigan feeding. Doc, murderously inclined,
fired some ten shots at one of them
before it flew. Indeed, so recklessly did he
scatter his leaden pellets as the birds rose,
that old Shanghai, one of our Indians, called
to me: &#8220;Hey, Billy, Billy! Come on! Damn!
Him make bullets whiz by head!&#8221;</p>

<p>As we reached lower levels, the blueberries
gave way to salmon-berries. They resemble
raspberries in growth and appearance, but
have a peculiar tart flavor. They were in
great abundance, and were much relished by
our party.</p>

<p>We arrived at camp in due time, tired and
hungry, but none the worse for our experience,
and after a short rest, quite ready for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
another tramp through the enchanting forest
of birch, Cottonwood, and hemlock.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="F_74" name="F_74"></a>
<img src="images/image167.jpg" width="500" height="542" alt="Ptarmigan" title="Ptarmigan" />
<span class="caption">Ptarmigan</span>
</div>

<p>On our way through the woods the Indians
gathered for snuff-making a great many
fungi growing on the birch trees. In preparing
the snuff, they first take a birch limb
of sufficient size and with a pocket-knife cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
out a round hole about two inches in diameter
and an inch and a half deep; this is the mortar.
The fungi are then placed in the hot coals
of a birch-wood fire until they are charred
through and through, when they are broken
into the mortar with a like amount of tobacco
leaves. Then with another piece of birch
wood about three feet long for a pestle the
mixture is ground in the mortar until it becomes
of the color and consistency of a moist
snuff. This the Indians continually chew and
rub in their teeth. Of the many uses of the
noble birch surely this is the most unique.</p>

<p>From the seedling to the giant tree the
life history of the birch is one of usefulness
to the inhabitants of the wild. The hardwood
ridge over yonder looks like the woods
in the vicinity of a beaver community, only
over a much larger area. Acres and acres of
birch trees averaging two inches in diameter
are broken off a couple of feet from the ground
by the giant moose, which straddle a sapling
and bend it down to browse upon the boughs
and tender twigs of the top. An old-timer
in the country told us that once after a hard
winter he came upon several &#8220;moose yards&#8221;
in the spring and found many bodies of moose
that had starved to death. He also told us
that he had saved the lives of quite a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
by cutting down trees where they could feed
and thus tide themselves over a severe spell
of bad weather. The birch-buds nourish
the grouse during the winter. Birch-bark
starts the fire and birch-wood furnishes the
fuel. Birch-bark supplies the natives raw
material from which to manufacture canoes
and various utensils and trinkets. Taking
it all in all I do not know of any other tree
of the forest that is put to so many uses.
An interesting instance of its application to
the culinary art comes to mind. According
to a tradition in our family, some of whom
were pioneers in the Huron district of Canada,
the Indians taught them to make a very fair
substitute for baking powder out of a compound
of the ashes of birch and hickory wood.
I am sorry I never learned the formula.</p>

<p>Around the camp fire we gathered just
before retiring. The night was dark. The
doleful cry of the solitary great northern
diver (<i>Urinator imperator</i>) came through the
stillness of the invigorating atmosphere, and
scarcely would the echo die away in the
distant hills until the call was repeated.
The bird may have been floating on the
surface of the lake, or flying in the air, calling,
as it frequently does while in flight. The
native Indians, like the sailors, do not take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
kindly to the laughing of the loon, for there
is a superstition among them that it forebodes
bad weather or some misfortune. The camp-fire
was burning brightly, cutting a luminous
hemisphere out of the inky darkness. In
the north the aurora borealis was throwing
its weird light in streamers stretched in a
semicircle over the horizon. While I was
admiring these the moon pushing up over
the black hilltop across the lake, looked
cherry-red. It seemed as though I was
under a spell. In my fancy I could see
a great boat approaching over the dark
water, with a huge search-light just rotating
into view and sweeping the northern heavens
with its rays. But even as I gazed the full
moon appeared in all its northern splendor,
the vision dissolved, and I realized that the
northern lights and Old Luna had played
a prank on me.</p>

<p>The next day we packed our belongings
and shifted camp some four miles farther
south on the same lake. As soon as the bow
of our little boat struck the shore we hopped
out and began a reconnoiter for a camp site.
A well-worn path across the narrow neck of
land separating one little fiord from another
attracted our attention. A stroll in that
direction disclosed a camp which had lately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
been occupied by some unknown party. On
a tree we found the card of our fellow townsman,
George Shiras, III., who had recently left
the camp for the sheep country. It was like
receiving a letter from home. How pleasant
the surprise had we been so fortunate as
to meet him! The &#8220;few days in camp together,&#8221;
suggested by his invitation of long
standing, would have been realized by a
strange coincidence. While he left civilization
from Seward, we departed by way of
Kenai, several hundred miles distant, yet
both arrived at the same place, he by way
of the upper Kenai and we by the lower.</p>

<p>A hurried pitching of camp in anticipation
of rain, which had been incessant for the
past four days, with only brief intervals of
relief from the downpour, put us in excellent
shape, with plenty of spruce boughs for
bedding, before the rain began to patter,
patter on the stretched canvas. To me a
most interesting experience is that of being
lulled into dreamland under such conditions.
It may be due to the effect of the ozone and
to the fact that in the woods one is always
tired when night comes.</p>

<p>On the following morning we divided the
parties and left camp in different directions.
After tramping many miles alone I came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
a swamp country. Crossing over one arm
of the swamp, wading up to my knees in
water, I came upon a path worn almost a
foot deep by moose traveling from one place
to another. I was unable to figure out why
they traveled backward and forward along
this particular route. After returning home
I learned from Mr. Shiras that not far from
this point was a salt lick and the path was
the regular route to and from the lick.</p>

<p>The path led through a little depression
in a ridge that projected into the swamp.
Mounting an elevation in the center of the
ridge, I could see on every side little lakes
and ponds, surrounded with alders and acres
of yellow swamp grass, an ideal home for
moose. Taking my field-glass, I looked in
every direction for game, and finally my eye
rested on a yellowish-brown object, then
another and another, which proved to be
cow moose feeding among the birches. While
resting, there came to my ears from another
direction the snapping of bushes. I knew
it was a moose feeding, a cow, to be sure.
I at once started in the direction whence
the sound came, and happened upon three
cows feeding and resting. They did not
seem to be wild, for on seeing me they threw
their ears back and hair forward, just like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
mules, then walked off a short distance and
stopped. In fact, they appeared to be very
tame and evidently knew that the law protected
their sex. While looking in the finder
of my camera I noticed that their curiosity
seemed to be aroused and that they were advancing
towards me a little too closely for
safety. I hurriedly set down my kodak and
raised my gun for fear the foremost would take
a notion to charge. Just at this moment she
wheeled straight around and with a trotting
motion, took to the closest cover. Before I returned
to camp my intention had been to come
back the next day, but I found the entire
party had decided to turn homeward the next
morning. What an opportunity I missed
to get some photographs of big bull moose!
The party saw at least ten cow moose that
day. Without a doubt, when the rutting
season arrived in about ten days, the large
bulls, now in the high timber, would be
scouring the forests in search of their
mates, bellowing in answer to the call of
their lady-loves.</p>

<p>As soon as he reached the camp that evening
Cheechalker began to inquire about his bath,
and his equilibrium was greatly disturbed
when the Indians refused to erect a tepee
for a sweat box and give him a bath. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
guide, pointing to the crystal water of the
lake, said, &#8220;Him good water, make good
wash.&#8221; Now Cheechalker took as kindly
to the crystal water as fish take to the land.
Finally the party went for a bath, each performing
his ablution in installments, and
while they were sunning themselves, Old
Sourdough took a header into the lake as an
example that they might follow. This was
too strenuous for the balance of the party
and they were satisfied to look on.</p>

<span class="caption">A Bath in Lake Skilak</span>
</div>

<p>Doc took a stroll along the beach with his
shotgun and returned with a brace of snipe.
The white crescent over the eye was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
conspicuous between the black bill and slaty-black
feathers of the crown.</p>

<p>Pulling stakes after our breakfast was over
next morning, we were soon on our way homeward.
We were just one day going down
the river. The current was very swift and
save for a few stops we made excellent time.
At two of the worst rapids we all got out
and the Indians ran the rapids. Before we
pulled into Kenai we were told the <i>Bydarky</i>
had left for Seldovia and would not make
another trip for three days, which, if true,
would be too late for us to catch the last boat
of the season from Seldovia to Seattle. After
arriving at Kenai we had about completed
arrangements for a little schooner to take us
up the inlet to Sunrise, on Turnagain Bay,
where we expected to get a train for Seward,
in time for the steamer, when, much to
our pleasant surprise, the belated <i>Bydarky</i>
came into port on her way to Seldovia.
We had been misinformed. We quickly
transferred our outfit, much relieved that
we would not have to miss the last boat of
the season.</p>

<p>At two o&#8217;clock in the afternoon the boat
left Kenai under full steam for the westward.
The waters of the inlet were as smooth as
glass and we were making good headway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
Not even a gentle breeze was blowing as
the sun disappeared behind the snow-covered
peaks of Iliamna and Redoubt. The afterglow,
reflected from the snowy cap, and the steam
bursting from the side of old Redoubt gave
it a weird appearance.</p>

<p>All the passengers had retired except Doc
and myself, who had been left without a
bunk. We first thought we would throw
our blankets on the floor of the combination
cabin, kitchen, and dining-room. A strong
breeze began to blow and we decided to go
into the hold for the night, coil ourselves up
in our duffel, and go to sleep. The wind
increased to a hurricane. What a night we
spent down in the hold of that old tub! She
was carrying little freight, had no ballast,
and could make no time. The tide caught us,
and between the outgoing and the incoming
tide-rifts the boat was tossed about at the
mercy of the elements. When she pitched
forward the propeller was out of the water
and spun like a button on a barn door. The
engine throbbed and beat, stopped and
started, with jerks and bounds, and the
climax came when it broke.</p>

<p>We were in the most treacherous water of
the Pacific, rolling and tumbling in the trough
and on the ridge of the high seas. The boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
was drifting out of the charted course and
toward a coast bristling with unknown rocks,
upon which we were sure of being lost. The
instant the engine broke, the engineer came
down the hatchway like a meteor. The boat
made a plunge and he landed in a heap on
top of the doctor, who was so sick that in his
misery he did not care whether the craft
went down or floated. Righting himself, the
engineer made a dash for the engine-room to
repair the damage. In the storm the poop
deck went to windward over the stern. The
repair-men were at work; above the din of
the hammer and chisel could be heard the
cargo shifting from side to side with the billows.
Oh! how I longed to hear again the
vibrating of the engine and smell the stench
of the fuel oil, which before the storm had
made our condition almost unbearable. The
doctor lying on the broad of his back
lifted his head and stared through the now
open poop deck and asked, &#8220;Where are
those sparks coming from?&#8221; I looked up
and thought the stack was belching sparks
from its fiery bowels. A second look, however,
sufficed to show that what seemed
to be sparks were the stars as they passed
back and forth over the hatch with the
rocking of the boat. The illusion was much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
more realistic than the narration of it would
indicate.</p>

<p>I mustered up enough courage to crawl
to the ladder, climbed up, looked out,&mdash;and
what a night! The stars seemed large and
brilliant enough for planets, the moon almost
large and bright enough for the sun. How
it danced on the foamy crests of the tide-rifts
when the whitecaps broke, throwing
the silvery spray all around the heaving,
plunging, tossing boat. Iliamna and Redoubt
stood in their majesty, silent onlookers at
the battle that was waging between the
little boat and the powerful elements,&mdash;wondering
who was going to be the victor. I
dropped bade into the hold half believing
it was all a dream, when I heard the captain
shouting to the pilot, &#8220;Keep her head on,
head on!&#8221; For fear of drifting upon the rocks
they were obliged to run many miles out to
sea before they dared make the turn for the
harbor. I heard him shout to the man at
the wheel, &#8220;Head her into the harbor as
quickly as possible when she is in the next
trough!&#8221; We had now reached the critical
moment,&mdash;would they select the right time to
make the turn? When the boat was turned
halfway to leeward and on the crest, the
turbine without resistance spun around at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
fearful rate, then the engine stopped for a
moment and the breakers struck the side
a terrific blow, causing the hull to creak and
groan as though it were human and about
ready to collapse. The water in the cabin
overhead swished back and forth and the
pots and kettles, as they beat against the
walls, kept time with the rolling and plunging
of the boat. The old tub righted herself,
we had crossed the danger line, and were
heading straight for the harbor.</p>

<p>When we reached quiet water the old-timers
shook their heads and vowed that
was their last trip in the <i>Bydarky</i>. What
happened in the bunks no one would tell,
though at least one of the party said that
during the night he had offered many a silent
prayer for the safety of the craft. There
was a foot of water on the cabin floor, the
pots and pans were drifting about amid a
flotsam and jetsam of pork and beans,
vegetables, and what not.</p>

<p>Thus we reached Seldovia and learned
that the steamer <i>Portland</i> was about due
on her last trip for the season. Coming
home by way of the inside passage, we had a
pleasant trip, full of interest in a hundred
ways. On one occasion, while many miles
from land, a curious little bird came fluttering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
from mast to mast. Evidently on its way
south it had become exhausted in the long
flight from some northern point and had
taken a short cut across the water. Finally
one of the passengers caught the little fellow
and it proved to be a crossbill. The mandibles
of this species are considerably crossed
to assist in picking seeds from the pine cones
of the northern land. It stayed with us all
day and seemed to be perfectly contented
and satisfied to be caressed in the open hand,
but just as soon as the boat neared land it
took to wing and with a graceful flight reached
the timber safely. So the days passed until
in due time we arrived at Seattle, where we
took the train for the East.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<br />
A TRIP TO NEWFOUNDLAND</h2>

<p>In the spring I had made all preparations
for a trip to Newfoundland, and arrived
at North Sidney to take the steamer <i>Bruce</i>
for Port aux Basques. Walking into the
offices of the company upon the dock to
make arrangements for my passage, my
attention was attracted to a little group of
men. I learned that the Government doctor
was vaccinating every passenger before allowing
him to enter Newfoundland, because at
this time Sidney had an epidemic of smallpox.
One of the officers shouted to me: &#8220;Here you,
going over? Bare your arm.&#8221; I answered,
&#8220;Not for me,&#8221; knowing it would be useless
to go into the woods with a punctured arm.
Just a little while before the boat cleared
I slipped aboard, heard the officer shout
&#8220;Cast away!&#8221; and we were off for Port aux
Basques.</p>

<p>The sea was rough and in the morning all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
the &#8220;landlubbers&#8221; were &#8220;pale behind the
gills.&#8221; On landing, every person called upon
the customs officer to have his baggage cleared,
and I was required to leave a deposit of fifty
dollars for the return of my Auto Graflex
camera. The train was scheduled to start
in a few minutes, and all the passengers were
aboard waiting for more than an hour, wondering
what was delaying the start. Inquiry
developed the fact that the trainmen were
waiting for the wind to subside before they
would venture across the viaduct over a
swamp a few miles out. It seems that the
train had been blown off the track several
times by a strong wind. We finally crossed
in safety.</p>

<p>Among the passengers were several fishing
parties, and they were bubbling over with
good fellowship in anticipation of the excellent
sport they were going to have in pursuit of
their favorite pastime. I believe every person
should have a hobby of some kind to divert
his mind from his burdens and petty cares.
A chance to do something that we like fills
us with pleasant thoughts, both in anticipation
and realization. Several of the fishermen
returned on the same train with me; they
looked much better and were quite talkative
about &#8220;whipping the stream,&#8221; their &#8220;wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>ful
casts,&#8221; and the &#8220;big fellows&#8221; they didn&#8217;t
get. Their hearty appearance confirmed my
theory.</p>

<p>Passing through the country, as far as the
eye could reach we looked out over barrens
covered with moss. Here and there a small
body of blue water, like a jewel, broke the
monotony. Perhaps a solitary duck floated
peacefully on its glossy surface, waiting for
the little brood soon to appear. Away over
yonder on the opposite shore of one of the
lakes stood a sentinel, the sandhill crane
(<i>Grus mexicana</i>), knee-deep in the water,
sedate and motionless, waiting an opportunity
to catch some unsuspecting fish that might
fortunately pass his way. The countless
herds of caribou had returned to the north
and were scattered all through the woodland
hills, attending to their domestic duties.
Towards evening the fishing parties began
to drop off, one by one, at Middle Brook,
Fischel&#8217;s Brook, and Harry&#8217;s River, all
ideal streams for salmon and trout. They
seemed scarcely able to restrain themselves
until the morrow, when they could joint
their rods, wade the crystal water, and cast
the Jock Scott or Silver Doctor into the
riffles again and again in anticipation of a
strike.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>Arriving at Bay of Islands in due time,
we found it a very interesting place, sloping
gently up from the water&#8217;s edge, with here
and there a two-story frame house on its
few acres of clearing. The inhabitants live
almost wholly by fishing. Each had his own
salmon net stretched out at some little projection
of rocks in the bay, for the salmon
were just beginning to run.</p>

<p>A guide employed, we made a trip up a
long valley by the old &#8220;Twitchen&#8221; road, used
years ago and grown up with alder, fir, and
balsam so as to be almost closed; up the old
caribou path, worn at some places three feet
deep in the moss and soft black mire by
countless herds of caribou that had passed
beyond. To one looking backward before
crossing over the divide, as far as the eye
could see extended the blue waters of the bay,
with the snow-capped mountains in the distance,
and in the foreground the park-like
lowlands where the stately caribou roamed
at will.</p>

<p>Our objective point was a small lake nestled
somewhere in the direction we were going,
among the pine, birch, and spruce, but on
the way we missed the location and got lost
in the undertaking. My guide climbed a
tree in order to get a peep of the lake, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a><br /><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>without success. While wandering about we
heard from afar the doleful &#8220;who, who, hum,
hee&#8221; of the loon. We had considerable
difficulty determining the direction of the
sound, but finally made a bee-line for the
lake. No sooner had we put in an appearance
than from a small grassy island in the middle
of the lake a dozen or more herring gulls
(<i>Larus argentatus smithsonianus</i>) rose into
the air, uttering their distressed, plaintive
cries as they soared round and round. After
getting a cup of tea and a bite to eat, we cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
down four or five old tree stubs, bone dry from
years and years of exposure to the elements.
Lashing them together with redwood twisted
into a &#8220;gad&#8221; and propelling the impromptu
raft with a pole, we landed safely on the
island. Our appearance startled from their
island home three little birds, whose whitish
down was covered with irregular dusky spots.
In their excitement one took to the woods,
and when requested to pose for its picture
displayed all the resentment and fierceness
charged to the American herring gulls. The
others took to the water. I am almost sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
this was their first experience in the water,
and how the little flesh-covered palmated
feet churned it in their desperate efforts to
lend the enchantment of distance to the view
of their unwelcome visitors. The colony
had almost deserted its annual nesting-ground,
but here and there a tardy mother bird had
not completed incubation, and the little
chicks were about due and calling to be
released from their prison. At the point of
the island, just at the water-line, we found
a loon&#8217;s nest (<i>Urinator imber</i>). Its two big
olive-brown eggs (size 3.50&#8221; &#215;  2.25&#8221;), marked
with dark brown spots, were lying on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
bare, wet ground, with a few rootlets scattered
here and there. The old pair floated gracefully
on the surface of the water some three
hundred yards in the distance, without uttering
a sound. What a contrast between the
gull and the loon in this respect,&mdash;the gulls
soaring in the air above us with great excitement
and noise, the loons quiet and apparently
resting peacefully in the blue distance! The
water in the lake was higher than usual.
A family of beaver (<i>Castor canadensis Kuhl</i>)
had dammed the entrance and had taken
possession by building their home close at
hand. Occasionally from the fortifications
came across the lake a report almost as loud
as a gun, the smack of the beaver&#8217;s flat tail
on the water as he disappeared when alarmed
by the intruders.</p>

<p>After taking several photographs we boarded
our raft, crossed over to mainland, and returned
homeward in the dead stillness of the evening.
Softly we make our way through the forest,
our feet sinking deep into the moss, turning
over with our toes the evergreen oval-shaped
leaves of the trailing arbutus (<i>Epigæa repens</i>),
exposing to the light of day the beautiful
delicate flower that loves sylvan seclusion.
Again and again I plucked a cluster which
filled the air with a fragrant perfume that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
mingled with the odor of the pine; then I
thought of the lines,</p>

<span class="i0">And waste its sweetness on the desert air.&#8221;</span>

<p>On the following day we took the train
for the head of Deer Lake, some thirty miles
away. After leaving the train we pulled
our boat across the lake and pitched our tent
on an island at the mouth of the Upper
Humber River. The day was beautiful, and
the sun hot enough that the eggs of the
mosquito, deposited at dawn, were wigglers
by noon. All day long the black flies made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
our lives miserable, and as night approached
the &#8220;nippers&#8221; took their place. Our tent
was brand-new and erected with the most
painstaking care, but we were unable to keep
them out. We made ourselves busy before
retiring for the evening by killing everything
in sight, black flies, mosquitoes, and spiders,
and then we tucked ourselves away on the
balsam fir bed for a night&#8217;s rest. But no
sooner were we fixed nicely than the music
began, and they seemed to come from every
direction, so the fight was renewed again and
again until we had exhausted ourselves and
our &#8220;dope,&#8221; and fell asleep from sheer weariness.
Their favorite point of attack seemed
to be behind the ears, and the singing still
continued, adding considerably to the torment.
In the morning our brand-new tent
looked like a slaughter house, all blotched
over with red, each mark indicating the
death of one of the vicious little pests.</p>

<p>The weather turned cold,&mdash;and how glad
we were to find relief! After breakfast we
started out in search of anything of interest,
and while walking down the beach we noticed
many little fine tracks on the sand; three toes
in front cleft to the base indicated immediately
that the maker belonged to the order of
waders (<i>Limicolæ</i>), and was about the size<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
of the little spotted sandpiper (<i>Actitis macularia</i>),
which builds its nest just along the
edge of sparsely-clustered bushes. Taking
the trail, we followed, scanning carefully
every likely place, and when we were within
a few feet of her the little hen bird left in
great excitement, twittering and flapping
her wings as she fluttered along the ground,
evidently trying to feign a crippled condition
to draw our attention from the nest. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
was built on the sand; just a very shallow
hole and a few small sticks and pieces of
bark; the four little cream-colored eggs with
their liver-colored spots rested in the center
of the nest, with a bunch of green leaves for
the background.</p>

<span class="caption">Merganser&#8217;s Nest</span>
</div>

<p>Going a little farther down the beach we
found the footprints of another bird on
the sands. The trail was scarcely deeper,
but quite different. At first sight we recognized
the track as made by a member of the
order of swimmers (<i>Lamellirostres</i>), for the
full palmated feet left their plain imprint,
with the three toes pressed a little deeper
in the sand than was the web, and with the
lobate toe leaving its delicate touch. We
followed the trail to a large white birch which
was partly undermined by the spring freshet,
leaving its mass of roots hanging down to
the sand. Getting down on my knees and
looking closely I saw a few feathers, and by
a long and careful straining of the eye could
make out the mother bird on the nest. She
was so well concealed it was absolutely impossible
to get a photograph of her in occupation
of the nest, so we proceeded to pull
some of the roots away and even touched
her in doing so; still she did not move from
her position; but before we got the picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
she left the nest with a &#8220;quack, quack,&#8221;
her neck extended and wings beating the
sand. The nest belonged to a family of
red-breasted mergansers (<i>Merganser serrator</i>),
and contained seven plain cream-colored eggs
(size 2.50&#8221; &#215;  1.70&#8221;); it was built of a few
small sticks and lined with down from the
breast of the duck. We visited the nest
several times afterwards, but believe it was
abandoned. At the upper end of the island
we pitched our tent, possibly half a mile from
the nest, intending to make a midnight visit
for the purpose of getting a flash-light picture
if possible. Before evening the birds could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
be seen a long way off taking in the situation
from the distance, but as the evening approached
they drew nearer and nearer and
then darkness enshrouded the landscape.
Although we could not see their flight over
our tent, we could frequently hear the whirr
of their wings long into the night as they
passed up and down, frightened and unable
to settle peacefully under the roots of the
old birch. The instinct for the protection
of her young is very strongly developed in
the merganser, and she will resort to every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
possible ruse to conceal them, coaxing them
into good cover, and, when once they are
concealed, leading you away in another
direction.</p>

<span class="caption">Nest of Wilson&#8217;s Thrush</span>
</div>

<p>In the early dawn, when the dew was
glistening on the vegetation and wild life
was full of activity, from underfoot glided
a Wilson&#8217;s thrush (<i>Hylocichla fuscescens</i>).
As I looked carefully in the direction whence
it came, a small opening in a clump of sticks
and grass disclosed a beautifully constructed
nest of moss lined with rootlets and coarser
grass, embedded in a small hillock. In the
nest were three delicate greenish-blue eggs
(0.90&#8221; &#215;  0.65&#8221;). We spent a great deal of
time making the acquaintance of the mother
bird, while the old man perched on a distant
limb, and at our approach seemed to give
warning by calling &#8220;chip, chip,&#8221; so that, no
matter how stealthily we drew near, the female
was aware of our approach and had left the
nest before we were in sight. That she had
only just gone was apparent from the warmth
of the eggs. We visited the nest many times
until finally she became very tame.</p>

<p>What a contrast to the nervous, excited titlark
which had built its nest on the ground
near a stump! The more we visited the nest
of the latter the wilder she became, and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
many attempts to photograph her we had
to give up in despair. By the time evening
came we were quite well acquainted, and
when night set in we tried to take a flash-light
picture of the thrush, using an electric
lamp to attract attention until the flash went
off. The instant of the flash she would glide
gently out of the nest, to return again in a few
minutes after we left. We made the attempt
many times, and finally she became so accustomed
to it that she would not leave the nest
when the flash went off.</p>

<p>The following day we heard a whistling
noise overhead,&mdash;a female American golden-eye
(<i>Glaucionetta clangula americana</i>) was
in full flight, disturbing the air with her
laboring short wings. Away over yonder
in a burned clearing stood an old birch tree
stump, gaunt and white with the constant
beating of the weather against it. Some
thirty feet from the ground was a large hole
in the stump, and as the duck passed by we
noticed that she hesitated as though about
to enter, but at the same instant she must
have seen us, for she continued her vigorous
flight up the river as far as we could see. We
decided she had her nest in the old tree-top,
and by concealing ourselves, gave her to
believe we had gone. In a short time we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
saw the duck return and pitch into the hole.
When she was once in her protected home
it was impossible to get her out. We hammered
the tree with stones and logs and threw
many stones into the opening; in fact, we did
everything we could to make her come out,
but to no avail. We then cut two long trees
and leaned them against the top of the stump,
and my guide proceeded to make rungs by
binding rope around them until he had a
fairly good ladder to the top. Then he
climbed up and looked into the hole, but
could not see the duck; she had built her
nest in the hollow branch and not in the
main trunk. The old stump began to sway
from a breeze that sprang up, so the guide
became nervous and hastened down for fear
it would fall. Taking his ax he decided to
cut the tree down, but when he was half
way through I persuaded him that the mother
and young would be killed by the fall, and
at my suggestion he let the old stump stand.</p>

<span class="caption">Learning to Swim</span>
</div>

<p>Several days later the young were transported
to the water by the old ducks, and
about the time the last duckling was placed on
the water, we arrived on the scene.<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>very interesting to see them trying to dive;
they were only able to stick their heads
under the water, exposing their white under
tail-coverts. As our little boat advanced
quietly over the water, the mother bird, in
her excited efforts to get them concealed,
swam now this way, now that way, and made
many attempts at turning into an apparent
shelter, only to come out again. After many
such zig-zag efforts she decided to take to
the open water with her brood. In the
meantime we were approaching nearer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
nearer and when we separated them the mother
disappeared in the direction of the open lake
and the ducklings were forced towards the
sandy beach. Thus separated we were able
to guide them up and down the shore according
to our liking, being careful to keep
them along the sandy beach where they
could not find any cover to conceal themselves.
We followed them for several hours.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1_2" id="Footnote_1_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_2"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Some authorities say that the mother duck carries the young
to the water in her bill. Whether this or some other means is
adopted, seems to be as yet a mooted question.</p></div>

<p>This little family had not received many
lessons in the way of providing for itself,
and when we cut the ducklings off from their
mother, fear was uppermost in all their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
actions. The instinct of fear gradually left
them and in its place the instinct of hunger
evidently gained the ascendancy. In the
beginning they would swim and paddle over
the water in great alarm, calling with a faint
&#8220;quack, quack,&#8221; trying to dive and distance
their pursuers. Occasionally they would
walk a little on the shore and then take to
the water again. We followed them up and
down until they finally seemed to pay little
attention to us, and how interesting it was
to watch them diving in the water for bugs
and minnows to satisfy their hunger! Several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
times we saw them bring their prey, small
minnows or mollusca, to the surface and
swallow it. When we first met in the morning
they could scarcely dive under the surface
of the water. In the afternoon they would
disappear for quite a while at a time, and as
each in turn would appear and disappear
they kept us guessing as to the duration and
depth of their dives. Thus we left them.</p>

<p>As we floated leisurely along, the trees
skirting the edge of the forest cast upon the
surface of the lake their long reflections of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
green, mingled with the red, blue, and purple
of the sun&#8217;s rays. We heard the harsh notes
of the kingfisher (<i>Ceryle alcyon</i>) as it skimmed
gracefully over the water and, ascending
with a quick movement, perched on an old
dead limb. With the field-glasses could be
distinctly seen her belted markings of white,
her ashy blue and rufous color, and her
elevated occipital crest. She remained for
some time motionless, according to her characteristic
habit, when like a flash, with a
rapid movement of her long, pointed wings,
she made a plunge, disappeared for an instant,
and then with a small fish made a graceful
flight to her sylvan retreat. Here she delights
to build her nest in a perpendicular
bank washed at the base by a swift current,
a protection from intruders. Quietly the
canoe entered the mouth of a little creek and
at an abrupt bend there was almost a collision
between the man in the boat and the
kingfisher returning to its home. With a
series of rattles, backing of pedals, and evolutions
in the air, the frightened bird, naturally
timid and of secluded habits, hastened
away.</p>

<p>The gnarled and picturesque old birch,
with its smooth white-spotted bark twisting
and curling in every direction, covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
ages of moss and lichen, spread its drooping
limbs gracefully over the water. Among
the slender twigs, with their long-pointed,
triangular, saw-toothed leaves, were many
redpolls (<i>Acanthis linaria</i>) feeding on the
brown buds, clinging in all conceivable positions,
like boys picking cherries.</p>

<p>The day was hot, and late in the afternoon
a warmer stratum of air saturated with vapor
was being driven up the mountain-side. We
knew by the uniform gray tint that a nimbus
cloud was forming and we could expect a
heavy rain erelong. As we glided over the
smooth water of the lake, looking anxiously
for a good temporary camp site, large drops
of rain, spreading a silvery spray over the
surface as they struck it, hastened our progress.
Heading our craft direct for shore,
the oarsman plied the oars with full force,
expecting to make a jump to beach as the
bow neared shore, but just about the time
he straightened up the boat struck a rock
and away he went, head first, over the duffel
and into the water. A hearty laugh, and we
were tugging away at the boat, doing our
utmost to get out the tent and save harmless
our bed and board. Fortunately on the
edge of the bank was a grassy spot large
enough to spread a small wall tent. Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
our tent-poles with us, already cut, we
formed a crotch by tying ropes around
the ends. The center pole was thrown
into the crotch, and while I steadied the
frame Charley slashed four pins out of
young saplings, the four corners of the
tent were staked down, and in less time
than it takes to write it we had a good
shelter for the outfit.</p>

<p>The rain was increasing while we rustled
the outfit to cover. With the woods appetite
we hastened the frying pan onto the
fire as the resinous smoke curled in rings
gracefully away from the tent, and by the
time the pan was hot and the solid chunks
were aglow, speckled beauties, fresh from
the riffles, were curling and drawing, but
the rain-drops, sizzling and sputtering, marred
their symmetry by making them stick to
the pan. In the meantime the forked pole
was punched into the soft soil until it
leaned at an angle above the fire, and the
coffee-pot was soon boiling over, adding
its sweet aroma to the already fragrant
atmosphere.</p>

<p>It was evident that the weather was clearing
up. Looking toward the purple foothills
the air was rapidly taking up the vapor and
mist, and the sun peeped out from its con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>cealment,
illuminating the lake with radiant
splendor. We walked up the old lumber road,
abandoned many years and almost covered
with underbrush, to a deserted cabin, with
its tumble-down roof and moss-grown sides.
A small stream of pure, cold water gurgled
as it disappeared under a decayed and broken
corduroy bridge,&mdash;an ideal spot to cast for
trout. A little beyond, the jack pines towered
their heads high in the air, each vying with
the other for supremacy over the light and
sun. Close by stood a beautiful birch, which,
after the manner of those who wear a band of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
black crape around the arm in respect for the
memory of some dear one, wore a band of
crape encircling its very trunk, in token of
its own premature death. The work of a
novice or the spirit of destruction was plainly
evident, for the living cambium had been
destroyed and pulled off with the bark. The
wilful destruction of trees casts a sadness
over me when I think how easy it is in a few
moments to destroy that which it has taken
the wise Creator years to develop. No
wonder the spirit of conservation is spreading
over the country!</p>

<p>A short cut through the woods disclosed
timber in every stage of decay, from the
tall, stately birch, frayed at the very top,
like a bald-headed man, to the giant lying
prostrate on the ground, uprooted by the
wind years before and covered with moss
and decaying leaves. As you step upon the
moss, down you go to your knees into the
rotten trunk, and it seems to say, &#8220;Dust
thou art, to dust thou shalt return.&#8221;</p>

<p>When we arrived at camp several Canada
jays (<i>Perisoreus canadensis</i>) were in evidence,
examining every nook and corner and exercising
their well-known powerful instinct
in this respect; in fact, their curiosity is so
overpowering that they have no fear of man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
and in a short time become very tame. They
are well-known camp robbers, and carry
away everything that strikes their fancy.
In this instance they were busy toting away
into an old tree-top remnants of trout, both
cooked and uncooked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>Towards evening, a dead stillness pervaded
the air, broken occasionally by the &#8220;hoot,
hoot&#8221; of an owl and the sharp smack of the
beaver&#8217;s tail on the water as he was disturbed
in his night prowlings. Through the stillness
came to us the sweet notes of the white-throated
sparrow (<i>Zonotrichia albicollis</i>) roosting
among the fragrant boughs of the balsam
fir. His song may have been inspired by
the changed and refreshing atmosphere, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
perhaps he was inquiring about the welfare
of his little mate as she brooded over her
four wee brown-speckled eggs carefully laid
in the small arched house on a cushion of
moss lined with fine grass and rootlets.</p>

<p>Arranging our bed of balsam boughs, we
were just about ready to blow out the light,
when my half-breed guide, who held the
candle in his hand, suggested that he offer
up a little prayer. I assented to his desire
and he knelt on the boughs with the candle
in his hand, while with face upturned he
remained silent in this suppliant attitude
for some time. The mellow light of the
candle on his swarthy, upturned face, amidst
the quiet solemnity of the night, was very
impressive and turned my earnest thought
to the higher things of life. It touched me
very deeply. I thought if this simple child
of the forest had so much to be thankful for,
how much more we, a happy, prosperous
people.</p>

<p>Just as the half-risen sun kissed the tips of
the mountains, we pushed our little craft
from the shore. Gently the current caught
the stern, and like a magnet drew the boat towards
the head of the Lower Humber,&mdash;gently
at first, but faster and faster as we neared the
rapids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>The woodman with his ax had been at
work. Floating silently with the current
were two large tree-trunks felled by the ax
of the lumberman. The one, with grayish-brown
bark, is known as the white spruce
(<i>Picea canadensis</i>), a tree until recently of
no value, its foliage nasty smelling, its wood
soft and brittle. When burned it cracks and
throws off sparks that eat holes in the wearing
apparel of the camper-out. The other, with
its white resinous bark, was the canoe birch
(<i>Betula papyrifera</i>), which has given pleasure
to man from time immemorial, and is used
in so many ways by both Indian and white
hunters. On the latter three white gulls,
with their mantles of black, were standing
with heads bowed, as though respectful
mourners at the funeral of the noble birch
that was moving faster and faster towards the
rapids. About the time the log reached the
brink of the boiling and seething waters
the mourners left it to its fate. The
current tossed and pitched it in every conceivable
direction, and at last plunged it
into the billows head-on, where it disappeared,
and after being lost to sight for
some time finally floated gracefully into
an eddy not much the worse for wear and
tear, turning around like an animate being,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
while the little voices of the forest seemed
to unite in praise of their hero. The old
spruce with its soft substance appeared
tattered and torn&mdash;&#8220;unwept, unhonored, and
unsung&#8221; by any except the new man&mdash;the
pulp manufacturer.</p>

<p>At the head of the rapids we made a landing
and walked through a beautiful strip of woods
to select a camping-site. When we reached
the foot of the rapids we found a place to
our liking. I suggested to the half-breed
that while he prepared a dwelling-place I
would go and shoot the rapids with the boat.
He positively refused to let me go, and in
fact would not allow me to get in the boat
for fear we should capsize, saying that several
of those who had tried to run the river at
this point had lost their lives. When I saw
our little craft float the rapids like a duck
and swing gracefully into the haven of safety,
I naturally felt relieved. We pitched our
tent on a grassy bank above the water where
it surged back into an eddy, as though it was
tired after its swift and tumultuous passage
over the bowlders, and longed to tarry for
a short time to enjoy the quiet and peaceful
pool. We spent several days in this locality,
roaming among the spruce and pines. Under
the secluded spruce the bunchberries (<i>Cornus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
canadensis</i>) love to grow and blossom. After
the flowers fade, from the whorls come
clusters of red berries that, mingling with the
moss, work out fantastic patterns on the
beautiful natural carpet.</p>

<span class="caption">Bunchberries</span>
</div>

<p>Into the pool were brought many insects,
larvæ, and frogs, which invited schools of
speckled trout to enjoy the quiet waters
where we took advantage of the natural
haven for our little craft.</p>

<p>Toward evening a colony of tree swallows
(<i>Tachycineta bicolor</i>) invaded the surrounding
valley, feeding on the numerous insects. As
we watched their flight the under white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
plumage looked like silver streaks. So
rapid were their movements that the wings
were scarcely perceptible, and when they
skimmed the surface of the meadow and rose
gracefully over the willows below us, the
beautiful cerulean of their upper plumage
so harmonized with the deep blue of a rainbow
which spanned the heavens at that moment,
that the air seemed to shimmer and sparkle
with light and motion.</p>

<p>The tiger swallow-tail butterflies (<i>Papilio
turnus</i>) were very plentiful. The cook had
thrown on the shore the heads and entrails
of fish and by some unknown method the
butterflies were able to ascertain its location.
During the afternoon some twenty-four butterflies
actually collected around the refuse
and with their antennæ sensed the dainties&mdash;shall
I say?&mdash;that seemed to appeal to their
taste. When one approached too close, all
would take wing and the air was filled with
yellow fancies as they scattered in all directions.
They soon returned and seemed to
bring their friends and neighbors with them,
for at each flush they were more numerous
than before.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">The &#8220;Steady&#8221;</span>
</div>

<p>The Humber looked calm and peaceful in
the big &#8220;steady.&#8221; How serene and beautiful
the mountain appeared in Nature&#8217;s mirror!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
How charmingly all the natural colors were
reproduced in the reflection on the placid
lake! Even the purple foothills displayed
their beauty as they clung to the weeping
willows along the shore-line. Here and there
the water was broken occasionally by the
jumping of the salmon and trout on the way
to the spawning-waters. The little brook,
now full, came tossing, plunging, and pitching
with a great noise down the mountain, and
at its mouth, gracefully idling away the time,
were thousands of trout jumping and splashing
in the spray, waiting to strike and dart away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
with any larvæ or bug that was caught by
the onrush of the water. Under such conditions
the angler could gather a rich harvest,
for the trout takes the bait just as soon as it
touches the water, and darts away, making
the line &#8220;sizz&#8221; as it cuts through, breaking
again and again until after a desperate struggle
he gives up to the inevitable and is landed
safely in the boat. Man is not the only
creature familiar with this condition and the
feeding habits of the fish. At the mouth
of every stream the merganser loiters with
her family to take toll; the kingfisher makes
its morning call along the route; the loon,
swimming gracefully around the projecting
willows that quiver in the gentle current,
disappears like a flash, and another is added
to the tally; the osprey soaring through the
air takes a dive beneath the surface and
brings up one of the finny tribe, then makes
a true line to the top of the old dead tree stump,
where the young are waiting with
stretched necks and open mouths to receive
their allotment.</p>

<p>While we anchored to an old snag that had
drifted with the current into an eddy, there
appeared from the depths the head of a muskrat,
moving gracefully around in a semicircle
and throwing off little wavelets that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
broadened as they approached the shore.
The cast of the fly frightened His Majesty,
and with a &#8220;whack&#8221; of his tail on the water
he disappeared, but erelong again came to
the surface. What a contrast in the disposition
of the muskrat and its cousin, the
beaver! The latter loves solitude and builds
its lodge in the most inaccessible places that
can be found in the fastness of the uninhabited
mountains and along some stream where the
foot of man seldom treads. The other colonizes
near civilization in some old dam or waterway
thrown up by man. Under the protection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
of the law, beaver are becoming more plentiful,
and occasionally at the mouths of little creeks
can be seen limbs of birch and willow freshly
peeled; if the winding course of the stream
is followed, you are sure to come upon a
dam, lately completed by a pair that have
of their own accord left the old lodge to seek
their fortune in a new home. The dam is
usually constructed first and then the lodge
a short distance above, and wonderful in the
building of the dam and lodge is the skill of
this little animal, known as the King of the
Rodents.</p>

<p>A little way below, the waters separated
around an acreage of island that afforded
protection for the homes of numerous gulls
and fish ducks. The undergrowth was very
dense out to the edge of the perpendicular
wall rock. The mergansers constructed on
the ledge their shallow nests encircled with
a ring of down. When approached they
sailed gracefully along a descending plain a
hundred yards beyond, closed their wings,
skimmed elegantly over the water several
yards and then floated about, perfect pictures
of grace, beauty, and ease combined. Seal
Cove loomed up in the distance with its two
sides of perpendicular reddish sandstone. The
gently sloping water front was the breeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a><br /><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>-ground
for quite a few harbor seals. They
are naturally gregarious, and as we approached
them one by one they slid into the water. In
a few seconds, noiselessly a shiny black object
resembling the head of a dog would come in
sight some distance away, and scarcely a
ripple of the displaced water marked the spot
where the seal emerged. Again and again
it appeared and disappeared until a mere
speck in the distance. Climbing the rocks
we saw remnants of numerous white woolly
suits discarded by the newly-born baby seals
before they took to the water, where with
their brand-new spotted sealskin coats they
could be seen sporting and playing before
the big bulging, affectionate eyes of the
mother. Seals love to spend a great deal of
their time resting, sleeping, and sunning
themselves on the rocks. Their hearing is
not very acute and they can be approached
easily by stalking. They are very tenacious
of life and when shot must be killed instantly
or they will slide into the water and disappear.
My Indian guide shot a large bull
around the region of the heart, and it would
have reached the water although mortally
wounded if the Indian had not caught hold
of its flippers and pulled back with all his
strength. All the time the bull was snapping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
viciously at him just like a dog. The northern
seal is much prized by the natives for its
economic value, its flesh, fat, and skin being
in great demand. Seal hunting in these
waters has been a great industry for years.
The Newfoundlanders are a hardy race, and
when hunting seal on the ice floes must endure
great privations.</p>

<p>While at Bay of Islands an old sailer came
into port with a young man aboard, penniless
and very sick. He lived in the interior and
the captain was trying to raise money to send
him on the train to his home. The lad knew
he was going to die and was anxious to reach
home to make amends to his old father and
mother for seeking, against their wishes, a
life on the seas. Passengers contributed the
money and sent word to the captain, but
before the train arrived the poor boy died.</p>

<p>The train pulled in, not in due time, but
several hours late. The conductor shouted
&#8220;All aboard!&#8221; and as it slowly left the bay
my thoughts turned homeward. It is then I
begin to feel anxious about the folks at home
and wonder if all is well.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<br />
HUNTING WITH A FERRET</h2>

<p>Having many times tried with indifferent
success to photograph the rabbit
in his native fields and woods, I cast about
for a means of stalking him at close range,
and had for some time cherished the idea
of taking a hunt with my kodak in a good
tracking snow. Thus intent, I jumped from
a passenger coach one day in the late fall,
equipped with an Eastman twelve-shooter
and ammunition enough to make a big bag.</p>

<p>I had left the station scarcely more than a
couple of hundred yards behind along the
public road, when I leaped a stake and rider
fence, crossed a stubble field, bound for the
bottom land. A field covered with tall,
dry grass, right at the edge of a brier patch,
looked a very likely place for cottontail.
Just as I reached the little creek covered
with ice, save where here and there the rippling
water crossed the shallow, pebbly places,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
I struck a fresh trail. Carefully examining
the footprints in the snow, which had fallen
early the preceding day, I reached the conclusion,
from the trodden condition of the
ground and the little round brownish excrement
lying here and there on the surface of
the snow, that this was his playground and
I must look elsewhere for the quarry. So
I began a large circle around the brier patch
to catch the trail to his bed. After passing
several times around the thicket, I finally
discovered the latest trail out. Bunny
usually travels by long jumps from the time
he makes up his mind to retire for the day.
The trail followed what seemed the most
cautious route&mdash;under an old fallen tree,
then two long jumps and into an abandoned
ground-hog hole. I cut a pole with the intention,
if possible, of routing Bunny from his
quarters. About the time the pole was half
way in, out he popped from an unexpected
direction like a flash, made a dash for a brush
heap nearby, and disappeared even before
I could get the camera into action.</p>

<p>When a rabbit is once driven out of a hole,
it seldom re-enters unless hard pressed by
the dogs. I have trailed them in the snow
for hours, reading the story from the footprints
as they ran, now hopping along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
leisurely, now doubling and following old
tracks under, through, and over logs. In one
instance Br&#8217;er Rabbit showed considerable
ingenuity in making a long side jump to
a board fence and squatting where the
color of fence and rabbit was almost the
same, by this simple ruse eluding his pursuers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<span class="caption">Color Blending</span>
</div>

<p>Later I accidentally came upon some fellows
who had put a ferret into a hole. In
a short time he stuck his nose out, sniffing
the air for the scent of the quarry, circling
the open for the lost trail. When the owner
made a slight movement towards him he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
instantly disappeared into the hole. For
fully an hour the men tried in vain to catch
him as he appeared alternately at either end
of the tunnel. Grass had grown around the
entrance, and the ferret was busy trying to
carry enough into the hole to make a comfortable
bed and take up his abode there, unceremoniously
abandoning the snug quarters
in his master&#8217;s pocket. Several times they
almost succeeded in getting hold of him by
taking a bunch of grass and poking it towards
him. This he would grab, hold until his
owner had pulled him out almost far enough
to catch him, then let go, sniffing as he scurried
back out of reach. Finally they were obliged
to try a new scheme, and one of them was
sent to a neighboring house for a piece of
fresh meat. They tied a string to the meat
and lowered it into the hole; whereupon the
ferret instantly snatched it, and forgetting
his late resolve, held on so tenaciously that the
hunter soon had him back into the bag.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<img src="images/image226.jpg" width="500" height="383" alt="Putting in the Ferret" title="Putting in the Ferret" />
<span class="caption">Putting in the Ferret</span>
</div>

<p>On the second day out, the snow was fast
disappearing from the open under the influence
of a bright sunshine, though it was still quite
deep in the woods and on the northerly slopes
of the high hills. While looking for tracks I
succeeded in gaining the confidence of another
party of rabbit hunters who had a good dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
and a &#8220;long pole,&#8221; as they called it, and
directly I obtained an invitation to accompany
them as they hunted for signs of the little
cottontail. I accepted with some hesitation,
determined to take a few observations
of the operations of modern &#8220;game hogs.&#8221;
Soon we heard the short, sharp bark of the
old hound, indicating that a start had been
made; and about the same time a shout rent
the air, &#8220;Here he goes!&#8221; as the little white
tail dodged in and out from one cover to
another, disappearing in the distance with
the old hound in hot pursuit and baying at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
every jump. Presently, in the language of
the coon-hunter, the dogs tongued &#8220;Treed,&#8221;
which in the dialect of the rabbit hunter is
&#8220;Holed,&#8221; and erelong the law breakers gathered
around the hole at the root of the tree.
I was hoping the tree was hollow and that the
little rabbit who had made such a good long
run for his life had climbed the tree and would
be safe from the ferret, but my hopes soon
vanished when I heard the rumbling noise,
first faint in the depths, then coming nearer
and nearer as he approached the opening.
A hasty scramble by the man on his knees,
a muffled &#8220;d&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;, a wish expressed that he
had used his net, and the little rabbit was
away again in a race for his life, minus a tail
taken by the ferret and a patch of skin and
hair taken from his back by the big fellow
at the hole. Then follows a long chase during
which the old dog overleaps a little bunch of
gray as it squats in the grass. For, knowing
that the enemy is fleet of foot and is
likely to pass hurriedly by, overlooking in
his haste the clod of color that blends
with the dry grass, he crouches low and
gains an opportunity to double on his
tracks. His ruse misleads the pursuer for
a short time at least and requires a halt
in the chase, which gives the fugitive an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
opportunity to reach some oft-frequented
harbor of refuge.</p>

<p>Again he is tracked to his hiding-place, and
again the little bloodthirsty creature is turned
loose to drive him from cover. Bunny,
always on the alert, makes a bolt for his life
with the ferret at his back and the old hound
waiting at the other end of the hole to crush
his life out. He stops a moment at the entrance
as the dog makes a vicious snap at
him, returns to meet his arch enemy, lets
out a pitiful squeal, and meekly allows his
life blood to be sucked without further resistance.
His courage and dash are gone and he
quietly submits to his cruel fate at the hands
of the lawless &#8220;game hogs.&#8221; After the
entrance is dug out a long arm is extended
into the hole and Bunny is slowly dragged
forth with the ferret hanging on like grim
death.</p>

<p>Again the biggest &#8220;game hog&#8221; of the
party could be heard shouting to the dogs,
&#8220;Whoop her up, Dan,&#8221; urging them on the
trail of another innocent little rabbit that has
a slim chance for life.</p>

<p>While hunting for fresh signs we ran across
a little cottontail hanging by his head, caught
in a snare set by another type of hunters who
bag their game by means of knife, twine, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
apple. A nibble at the apple, the trap is
sprung, and the noose tightens around his
neck, dangling little cottontail in the air
just low enough for his hind feet to touch
the ground, and slow strangulation continues
until life is extinct. In the morning when
the trapper reaches his snare he finds the
rabbit frozen stiff, with tongue protruding
and eyes bulging from their sockets. Surely
he is not without a pang of conscience as he
gathers up his catch.</p>

<span class="caption">His Last Nibble</span>
</div>

<p>I was startled out of my contemplation
by the sound of the old dog giving tongue,
and the bang of the musket echoing in the
tree-tops. Listening, I could hear the dogs
baying on the trail some distance from where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
the shot was fired,&mdash;plainly a clean miss.
In a short time the language of the hound
again announced &#8220;Holed,&#8221; and the gathering
of the heartless around the spot told the
same old story. At my suggestion, &#8220;Give
the rabbit a chance,&#8221; the dog was removed
from the hole, when out popped the rabbit.
The dog in hot pursuit soon overtook him,
but failed to pick him up. Twice the little
fellow fooled the dog, but the third time his
doom was sealed. The dog returned with the
rabbit kicking in his mouth, and laid it at
the feet of his master as a trophy worthy of
the chase, occasionally nosing it to see if any
life remained. Truly this cannot be sport.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>Crossing the hill we caught a view from
the distance of a beautiful meadow flanked
on one side by an old orchard, which long
needed pruning and was grown up with
blackberry briers. On the other side was a
thicket of locust, sumac, and elder, which had
been cleared several years before and the
debris piled on the stone heaps ready for the
match that had never been applied. Here
and there were stretches of stake and rider
fence; in fact, it was an old farm neglected
for many years owing to the death of the
owner and continued litigation among the
heirs for the possession of the land,&mdash;an ideal
home for the cottontail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>Crossing the meadow the dogs started a
rabbit which had been basking in the sun,
coiled up in a bed built in the middle of a
bunch of dry swamp grass. The little fellow
had remained perfectly quiet, although one of
the party passed within two feet without
seeing him, so well did his color harmonize
with the surroundings. He remained unobserved
until one of the dogs passing by started
him and warned the other dogs, whereupon
away they went in full chase. Through the
orchard, down along the old fence, sped the
fugitive, the dogs close behind, tonguing at
every jump. Into the thicket he plunged, safe
for the time being. The dogs began to circle,
caught the trail on the opposite side, and
followed it into another cover, where Bunny
squatted and presently we saw him returning
on his own trail. I made a run to head him
off so that I could get a snap-shot, but observing
me he stopped in the middle of a wheat
field. In the meantime the dogs had gathered
enough information and were working
their way back over the track until the leader
came on to him, and away they went. The
quarry returned towards the other dogs and
was picked up before cover could be reached.</p>

<span class="caption">Down the Old Fence</span>
</div>

<p>Again the dogs were urged to hunt the old
orchard. A start was made and away went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
a rabbit across the meadow on the far side
of which he darted into a burrow. The
ferret was put into a hole and out popped
three rabbits, one on the heels of the other.
Each dog followed one, but soon returned,
evidently unable to keep the trails, for they
all crisscrossed around the orchard. In the
meantime every effort was made to get the
ferret, without success, when finally one of
the unfeeling suggested shooting a bird. I
protested against shooting a song bird and
suggested an English sparrow, whereupon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
he promised to go down to the barn for a
sparrow. However, upon returning he handed
over a song sparrow (<i>Melospiza fasciata</i>),
with its long tail and brownish-streaked body
beautiful even in death. Charity impels
me to believe the man was ignorant rather
than willful. Pulling a piece of twine from
his hunting-coat pocket, he tied fast the bird,
a double hitch after hitch, so that the ferret
could not loose the bait and carry it into the
hole. When properly secured the bird was
thrown to the ferret, and instantly seized.
Each began to pull, when off went the head
into the hole. Returning promptly for the
body the ferret made another grab and was
finally coaxed out of the hole and caught by
the owner.</p>

<span class="caption">The Dog Listening to the Last Sound</span>
</div>

<p>The dogs began to work the trails and again
had a rabbit crossing the meadow for dear
life, they following close behind. He went
into a hole among the roots of an old tree, to
escape from his enemies, as he hoped, but
alas, only to a cruel fate! &#8220;Put in the long
pole,&#8221; said one of the boys kneeling at the
hole. The other started the ferret on its
death-dealing mission. In a few minutes
we could hear the smothered &#8220;Wah, wah,
wah&#8221; of cottontail, and a curse from the
heartless, not out of sympathy for poor little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
bunny, but because he knew the rabbit would
not make another attempt to reach the opening
and the ferret would stay there for days.
Fainter and fainter grew the pitiful moans,
until finally they ceased forever. One of
the men went for an ax to cut a way down to
the ferret. The hole took a downward course
into an old root, and by cutting through they
found the hole, reached in and pulled out
the dead rabbit. It was sickening to see
the condition of its head. The owner of the
ferret had a cruel heart, but even it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
softened a little at the sight, for he threw
the murderous creature away from him.
Instantly the big dog made a jump, grabbed
the ferret, and tossed him into the air several
feet before his master could interfere. A
feeling of satisfaction came over me when I
saw the toss, and I said to myself, &#8220;That
was your last kill.&#8221; But landing on his
feet he humped his back and at the same
time hissing through his teeth made several
vicious snaps at the dog and sought
protection by running towards his master.
Fortunately for him his master had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
sack open and the ferret hastened into it to
safety.</p>

<p>When I boarded the train for home that
evening I felt as though I had spent a day
in the shambles. Such slaughter seems to
me to be utterly unjustifiable, even in the
name of sport.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<br />
A NIGHT HUNT</h2>

<p>A coon hunt is always interesting to me.
Just as soon as night approaches and
you call old Stump, who has lost the tip of
his tail in a battle royal, he pricks up his
ears, begins to whine, and seems to know
that the boys are out for a coon hunt. As
you approach to loosen the snap that ties
him to the kennel he begins to wag what is
left of his tail and seems to say, &#8220;Boys, I&#8217;m
happy to be with you to-night!&#8221; The wrinkles
in his face twitch as the excitement grows.
His face and head indicate that he has been
in many a coon fight. On one occasion he
tracked a ground-hog into its hole underneath
an uprooted tree. Being then of tender years
and lacking experience, as the ground-hog
came out, Stump made a grab and at the
same time the ground-hog snapped Stump
by the nose and held on like grim death. It
took the combined efforts of men and dogs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
to separate them. Finally in the mix-up
Stump made one desperate struggle to get
away and lost the tip of his nose. Thus
with the two tips gone Stump entered the
arena as a full-fledged&mdash;shall we say?&mdash;and
experienced coon dog.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<img src="images/image239.jpg" width="500" height="338" alt="The Hunting Party" title="The Hunting Party" />
<span class="caption">The Hunting Party</span>
</div>

<p>We gather at the country farm, boys and
girls ready for the outing. Stump, Fan, and
Towser all are anxious for a night out working
the ravines and watercourses. Lanterns and
&#8220;pit-lamps&#8221; are shining brightly as we start
across the meadow. The dogs disappear in
the darkness. The fireflies flash here and
there as though to light our way across the
fields. One of the party, and by the way a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
fair one, steps into a pool of running water
and the night air is pierced&mdash;in fact, sadly
rent&mdash;by the shrill screams of the miss, for
this is her first experience &#8220;trekking&#8221; in the
dark. As we approach the woods the weirdness
of the scene is enchanting. Shadows
play on the trees and leaves, as though in
imagination one were transplanted into some
fairy-land. Away off among the timber
the great horned owl can be heard calling
to its mate, &#8220;Waugh ho! waugh ho!&#8221; just
before it makes an excursion into the fields
in search of some hapless rabbit or bird. The
crickets are fiddling away, making music
for their mates while they gather blades of
grass for their burrow.</p>

<p>Presently our eager ears catch the low
grunt of a dog as he gets the first whiff of the
trail, not fresh, but spent. By the reflected
light we see Towser wag his tail, slowly at
first, but as the scent gets warmer the tail
wags more vigorously. Soon one long, loud
wail resounds in the stillness of the night
and ere the echo dies away in the distance
it is repeated, and we know the chase is on.
Everybody runs toward the sound. The
quarry has taken to the tree and the dogs
bay up, but before the party reaches the
scene of action the dogs are off again. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
find the trail where the coon has followed
a grapevine for some distance, taken the
ground again, and &#8220;put one over&#8221; on the old
dog. After considerable delay the dog finds
his mistake, picks up the scent and away he
goes, and directly, on the other side of the
ridge, bays up. Then the party goes pell-mell
in that direction. And so the hunt
proceeds, now here, now there, up hill and
across ravine, until at last the coon is treed,
and the dogs by their change of voice tell
the news and summon the party, which
arrives in installments, out of breath, at the
foot of the tree where the dogs are panting
after their long chase.</p>

<p>Every one is eager for the finish. The
tree-climber of the party takes off his coat,
hat, and shoes and begins the ascent to shake
Mister Coon from the tree. A shout comes
from the tree-top, &#8220;Here he is; look out
below!&#8221; then follows a shake or two and a
large house cat disappears into the darkness
before the dogs can take hold. When the
cat came down it alighted on all fours near
the girls, and what with the girls screaming,
the dogs barking, and the cat spitting, night
was made hideous. We soon called the dogs
off and &#8220;hied&#8221; them on for a fresh trail.</p>

<p>By and by the dogs took another hot scent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
Down the hill, clambering over a stake and
rider fence,&mdash;a ruse which for a moment
confused the dogs,&mdash;then across a cornfield
to the creek went the coon with the dogs in
hot pursuit; he followed the course of the
creek for several rods, then dashed through
at the shallows and bid fair to make good
his escape to the woods beyond. But old
Stump had been through that maneuver
before; the rest of the dogs knew it and
followed him over to the other bank, up the
hill, under the cliff, and erelong bayed up.
Following as fast as possible over and under
dead trees, a jump of several feet over an
embankment, a slide of several feet more, a
brief climb and we reached the dogs, who,
excitedly voicing their triumph, formed a
circle around the tree as though appealing
to us for action.</p>

<p>The night was dark and just such a night
as was well suited for &#8220;shining&#8221; the eyes of
the coon. Lying flat on the ground and
staring into every part of the tree, I finally
descried two objects shining like stars near
together in the zenith. We knew they were
the eyes of the treed coon. Calling the dogs
we prepared to photograph them and the
coon in the mix-up. Setting up the kodak
about twenty feet from the spot where we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
figured the coon would drop from the tree,
we fixed the pan for the flash, loading it with
an ounce of flash-light powder. One of the
party held the dogs and another lighted
Roman candles and shot them towards the
coon. Thus we had the artist at the kodak,
the man in charge of the flash at the pan,
the coon hunters holding the dogs, and one
of Payne&#8217;s pyrotechnic men setting off the
fireworks. The combination was too much
for the coon. About that time the big dog
began to jerk at his chain, and the pit-lamp in
the hands of the man who held him registered
on the exposed sensitive film a sort of stylographic
record of the efforts of the dog to get
at the coon as soon as the latter landed on
the ground. As the coon dropped we set
the flash off, and caught both the dog and
coon about the time they came together at
the very spot on which we had focused the
lens.</p>

<p>The chase ended, the quarry caught, we
straggled back over the hills to the distant
trolley line, as Orion rose high toward the
zenith. A few hours more, and the eastern
sky would grow gray. Tired, but happy,
we jogged along, most of us in silence, for
about that time in the morning after a coon
hunt, the songs and jokes of the early evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
are stale, and our spirits, with the night, are
on the wane. Like an exploded skyrocket, we
are getting back again to earth as fast as we can
after our excursion into the realm of darkness.</p>

<span class="caption">Dog and Coon in the Mix-up</span>
</div>

<p>Note the forefoot of the coon between the dog&#8217;s hind legs; his
banded tail to the right of the dog&#8217;s right forefoot. The
zig-zag line in front of the man at the left indicates the
movement of his hand in which was a pit-lamp and the
end of the dog&#8217;s chain just prior to the flash.]</p>

<p>Another denizen of the woods is frequently
interrupted in his night prowlings by the dogs
hunting for coon. I refer to the oppossum,
who is himself frequently the object of the
quest. In the Southern States the negroes are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
very fond of hunting for &#8217;possum. A successful
hunt means a good dinner, the <i>pièce-de-résistance</i>
being the trophy of the chase
stuffed with sweet potatoes. Roasted and
served as only an old &#8220;mammy&#8221; can roast
and serve it, &#8217;possum defies comparison.
Perhaps roast suckling-pig comes the nearest,
but even this lacks the flavor of the woods.
We are used to thinking of the &#8217;possum as a
lethargic animal, but that is only when he is
&#8220;playing &#8217;possum.&#8221; He is really quite agile,
and when treed by the dogs, furnishes no end
of excitement by climbing, not into the tops
of the trees, as does the coon, but merely
far enough to be safe from his pursuers. I
have yet in anticipation the pleasure of
obtaining a flash-light of the hounds on their
hind legs, pawing and clawing at a tree on
which, just beyond their reach, the &#8217;possum
lies stretched indifferently on a horizontal
limb. One really ought to have a dictagraph,
so that when the picture is thrown
on the screen, it may be with the appropriate
accompaniment of the baying and barking
of the hounds and the shouts of the hunters.</p>

<p>The little animal is very prolific and rears
several families in a season. How interesting
it is to watch the antics of the young clinging
to the mother when disturbed! I have known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
cases where an old &#8217;possum, presumably alone,
was shaken out of a tree, and as she fell,
strange, plaintive cries were heard on all
sides. The rays of the lantern disclosed perhaps
a dozen young &#8217;possums, who had been
ruthlessly dislodged from the pouch or marsupium
of the mother as she struck the ground.
On such an occasion, if the parent is allowed
an opportunity, she will gather up the young
and hunt cover.</p>

<p>There is something quite comfortable and
clinging about the young &#8217;possums and their
mother (Frontispiece). The little fellows are
very roguish in their ways, and I have no
doubt would in time become friendly. The
&#8217;possum has very sharp teeth, and can do
good execution upon occasion, but as a
general rule he may be said to have a
"retiring" disposition.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<br />
IN THE SPRINGTIME</h2>

<p>As soon as the first harbingers of spring
arrive we take to the forest. Life
is just awakening in the northern woods.
The winter has been long and severe. Following
the course of the creek we see large
cakes of ice thrown topsy-turvy all over
the meadow, where they have been carried
by the spring freshet. In the gorge block
after block is piled; they are lying in every
conceivable position. The spring sun is busy
undoing what the hard winter has accomplished.
The cakes of crystal ice are fast
losing their deep blue color, becoming &#8220;rotten&#8221;
and breaking off in huge chunks with
a report that fairly startles one. The newly-exposed
ice-prisms glisten in the sun like
so many jewels. To add to the attractions
of the landscape, the creek is lined with
stately sycamores,&mdash;here and there a lonely
buttonball clings by a slender stem to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
parent tree, as though loath to break away.
Or perhaps it is hopeful that by some imaginary
elixir of life it may renew its youth and
live the spring and summer over again,
forgetful that on the verge of inaugurating
a new cycle of existence,&mdash;the birth of another
generation,&mdash;it has before it the great
consummation of all life. Where the hills
furnish a dark background the old tree stands
out, weird and majestic, its limbs white and
naked after shedding their cinnamon-like
bark. It glistens in the sunlight almost as
much as the ice-prisms. The high water is
busy undermining the bank of the stream
and an occasional cave-in appears, as though
some muskrat surprised in his foraging were
making a hasty departure for his tunnelled
home.</p>

<span class="caption">Home of the Cardinal</span>
</div>

<p>The woods are ringing with the song of
the cardinals (<i>Cardinalis cardinalis cardinalis</i>),
and just as soon as you enter their &#8220;beat&#8221;
they seem to take notice and are ready to
fight any intruder. It is a noteworthy fact
that the &#8220;sphere of influence&#8221; of a particular
cock is limited to a portion of a tract of woodland
as well defined as though surrounded
by a fence. If you can conceal yourself
in his zone and imitate his call, the bird will
approach very near. In my younger days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a><br /><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>many were the cardinals I trapped in the
following manner: In the mating season
we would take a caged bird into the woods,
the cage covered from the time we left home
until we reached the woods. Selecting a
likely place, we set our net, and attached
a rope which led to a blind constructed of
boughs put together as naturally as possible.
Then when all was ready we lifted the cover
of the cage. The sudden emergence from
darkness to light seemed to fill the very soul
of the caged bird with gladness, and even
before we could conceal ourselves behind the
blind it would break forth into the sweetest
melodies, filling the woods with its songs, as
though once again free in its erstwhile haunts.
Ere the first notes die away in the distance,
like an echo comes the answer from the
proprietary lord of that particular section
of woodland, as though he seemed to say:
&#8220;Some miscreant has entered my shady
bowers to entice my fair one away, so I&#8217;ll
teach him a lesson and drive him out of my
domain.&#8221; Again the voice of the caged
bird peals forth in a loud, clear whistling call,
but I have no doubt the notes are not so
sweet to the suspicious wild bird, for he is
answering in an angry tone. In the meantime
the wild bird is cautiously advancing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
flitting from limb to limb. If he comes from
the direction of the blind, he may be so near
that you can distinctly see the bristled rictus
and black mask on his face, the crested top,
and glowing red body. Presently he sees
the captive bird, makes a dive for it, and
hangs onto the wires, trying to get hold of
the intruder, picking and striking through
the narrow openings so excitedly that he does
not notice the net being pulled over him.
What loyalty to his mate we see in this little
bird! Thus many cardinals are caught. If
the other bird does not encroach on their beat
they will not answer to the call, but by shifting
the cage even fifty feet or less, it may enter
the domain of another and then he will show
fight even to the death.</p>

<p>The piping of the cardinal is shrill at times,
again soft, mellow, and soothing to the ear.
He is a perfect vocalist and is known as
one of the best whistlers among the feathery
tribes; indeed, by some he is called the American
nightingale. At times when he ends up
his song with &#8220;Pretty, pretty, pretty,&#8221; I
repeat the words, agreeing absolutely with
him.</p>

<span class="caption">Cardinal&#8217;s Nest and Eggs</span>
</div>

<p>He shows some strange antics occasionally.
Once we found a nest built in a crab tree
about three feet from the ground. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
we first found it there were four light blue
eggs blotched with liver-colored spots, laid
in a loosely-built nest of rootlets, grass,
and grapevine bark. About a week later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
when we visited it the nest was empty.
Looking toward the ground by chance,
I saw a little bird &#8220;in the down&#8221; apparently
without life. Lifting it up in my hand,
by close observation I noticed that it still
breathed. We put the bird into the nest,
went away, and returned in about thirty
minutes, when to our surprise we found the
nestling was gone again! Query, did the
mother bird carry away its offspring to
some place of safety where it would not be
disturbed?</p>

<p>On another occasion we found a nest in the
top of a grapevine. We drew down the vine,
photographed the nest, and restored the nest
to its original position. Calling the following
week I found the mother bird had incubated
the brood as though nothing had happened,
but the young were taken from the nest as
soon as they could be moved and some days
before they would ordinarily have been allowed
to leave home. Although the cardinal is
naturally shy and retiring, at times he will
permit one to get very close. I am glad to
think that in many of the States this beautiful
bird is increasing under the protection of

<p>While sitting on a moss-covered log enjoying
the balmy breezes of spring, the &#8220;dee, dee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
dee&#8221; notes of the tufted titmouse (<i>Parus
bicolor</i>) came to my ear. What hardy little
birds they are! The coldest winter of the
north does not affect them. They are fearless
of man at times, and if you keep quiet
they will flit about from place to place, alternately
disclosing to you now their ashy blue
backs, now their dull white, russet-flanked
under-parts, as they swing from twig to twig,
scanning each little crevice for a choice
morsel of insect life.</p>

<p>When the first warm rays hatch the winged
insects, the tragedy of the woods begins.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
A little cream-colored butterfly just out of
its winter garb is on the wing, floating gracefully
in the air among the leafless trees.
The titmouse, with his bright eye ever on
the alert, spies the insect, makes a sprightly
dart, and seldom misses his mark. Then he
perches on a limb with the fly and, like a
bird of prey, takes hold with bill and feet
and tears his victim apart, and as the remnants
of the little wings float slowly to the
ground, he feeds on the body.</p>

<p>The indigo bunting (<i>Passerina cyanea</i>) with
its exquisite lay makes its abode very attractive
to bird fanciers. In the mating season
he can be seen perched on the topmost twig
of one of the graceful drooping limbs of the
elm bush, a little blue ball of feathers, throat
expanded, pouring forth sweet music. If an
instrument could be invented to record and
reproduce the melody as he delivers it in the
stillness of the morning when the little songster
is at his best, it would become a very
popular air. The indigo is frequently kept
in captivity, but loses all the sweetness of
song and the little male soon drops his beautiful
livery and dons a distasteful shabby color,
lacking even the somber luster of the female.
During the period of mating, the cock-bird
can be trapped very easily by using a trap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
cage with a bird in the lower compartment.
As a boy, I have placed a trap cage on my
head, walked under the tree where the wild
bird was singing, with my mouth made a few
kissing sounds, whereupon the bird would
fly down into the cage and try to get through
the wires to the captive. If some wheat
grains were placed on the &#8220;paddle,&#8221; the wild
bird would invariably light on it first, and
picking up the grains would spring the trap
and be caught while the cage was on my
head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>In constructing their nest they usually
select a dense thicket and frequently build
near the ground, where they deposit four
or five bluish-white eggs not much bigger
than a large pea. The cowbird (<i>Molothrus
ater</i>), which is a sort of parasite, does not
build a nest of its own, but lays its eggs in
the nest of some other bird. In this respect
it shows its wonderful instinct by selecting
a smaller bird as foster-mother for its offspring.
By experience they have been
taught that the larger birds invariably dispose
of the eggs by removing them from the nest.
It frequently selects the bunting&#8217;s nest in
which to deposit its brown spotted eggs,
which are much larger. The cowbird, being
of a larger species, grows much faster, and
before long the foundling fills the little nest,
forcing the rightful owners out of home and
board. On one occasion I visited a nest and
found it almost upset, with the &#8220;big cow&#8221;
filling the whole nest. On the upper edge
perched one little bunting, almost featherless,
shivering in the cold. From underneath
the &#8220;parasite&#8221; could be seen the head
of the other, panting for breath and nearly
stifled. We removed the cowbird, straightened
up the nest, replaced the rightful owners of
the house, and perched the cowbird nearby on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
a bush. We then went off a short distance
and watched developments, and to our surprise
the little male bunting fed the cowbird
first. It was strange to see the youngster,
as large as his foster parent, open his mouth
so wide you could imagine he was getting
ready to swallow the old bird,&mdash;indeed he
looked as though he could, rapacious pirate
offspring that he was. On telling the story
to a friend, he remarked, &#8220;Well, how do you
account for the foolish old man neglecting his
own offspring and feeding the cowbird first?&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
I cannot answer that, unless the old fellow
was proud of his big son.</p>

<p>The red-eyed vireo (<i>Vireosylva olivacea</i>)
loves solitude. During the nesting season
it seeks some dense thicket, selects a fork on
a drooping limb, and constructs its wonderful
basket-shaped, pensile nest. Intertwining
about the fork a silky material for the basis
of the structure, they put together with
grasses, lichens, and plant fibres a wonderful
little home for their progeny. When working
away at building they are very cheerful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
almost continually singing a sweet, pleasant
warble, as though haranguing the dwellers
of the silent places, hence their pseudonym,
&#8220;preacher.&#8221; Very frequently in the dense
foliage nearby skulks another member of the
feathery tribe, watching every movement of
the industrious pair, and now she gloats over
them when, their work of art complete, they
flit from limb to limb, closely observing the
masterpiece and softly twittering their satisfaction,
as though to say, &#8220;Well done.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Tired and hungry after their labors they
wander away in search of food, singing
cheerily as they twitch their heads now this
way, now that, seeking a worm or insect.
When they have gone, the somber-gowned,
parasitic mate of a polygamist makes a bee-line
for the nest, hastily drops a large speckled
egg in the neat little basket, then quits the
thicket and returns afield to the flock from
which she came, leaving her ignominious
progeny to be hatched and reared by the
foster parents. When the vireos return, imagine
the little red eyes looking with surprise
at the egg that almost fills the cradle. They
have not the strength, even if it occurred to
them, to tumble the egg overboard, and
unlike the yellow warblers, who sometimes
build another nest on top of the egg, they
resignedly proceed with the family duties.</p>

<p>The cowbird is a parasite of the worst kind;
it lays its egg, not on the doorstep, like
some foundlings, but in the bedchamber. The
period of incubation being shorter than with
most other birds, the egg is hatched sooner,
the bird grows more rapidly, and consequently
young <i>molothrus</i> frequently stifles the rightful
owners of the home. One by one the vireo
fledglings die and are carried from the nest
by the mourning parents, and so the survivor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
flourishes and grows fat, rocked in the cradle
by the gentle breezes and under the care and
protection of the little red-eyed vireos. The
vireos are noted as good providers and protectors.
During incubation they are fearless
and loath to leave their eggs,&mdash;at times indeed,
will permit you to approach the nest within
two feet and photograph. We made several
attempts to get the picture on page 260
but without success, until with a hand-mirror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
as a reflector we threw the rays of the sun on
the bird. The light seemed to bewilder her
and had the same effect as a &#8220;flash-light&#8221;
has on a moose or deer in the stillness of a
dark night. Thus we were able to take a
photograph by time-exposure.</p>

<p>It is very seldom that a mixed family is
raised. Usually the children of the home
perish, and then how the young cowbird does
continually call to the foster parents, &#8220;hungry,
hungry, I&#8217;m hungry,&#8221; and how the little
birds must work to satisfy the fast-growing
changeling. At last one day the parents
find their darling has disappeared; their
summer&#8217;s work is finished; four cunning
little vireo nestlings have met an untimely
fate, and one arrogant young cowbird is well
started upon his infamous career. Despite
his careful rearing his blood will tell just as
surely as if he were human.</p>

<p>Over yonder, a stone&#8217;s throw from my
sleeping-porch, stands the stump of a hardwood
tree, now soft from years of exposure to
the elements. First the slender twigs decaying
dropped one by one, then limb after limb,
until all that remained of the noble tree, the
growth of years, was this stump, where one
bright morning in March I heard from my
bed the familiar tapping sound characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
of the woodpecker family. It was a flicker
(<i>Colaptes auratus luteus</i>). The mating season
was due, the ardent lovers were busy making
holes here and there, as is customary, until
finally they accomplished one to their liking
and began their domestic duties in earnest.
Some weeks later, in answer to my tapping
on the stump, a head appeared at the door
looking from side to side for the cause of the
noise. It was the father of the family who
reconnoitered the situation. The characteristic
broad streaks of black throat feathers,
commonly referred to as his &#8220;dark mustache,&#8221;
served to identify him. For some
time we had suspected the young were soon
to leave their home. Tom climbed the tree
in search of &#8220;data,&#8221; for the accumulation of
which he is quite eager, but before he got
half way up, shouted, &#8220;There goes one of
the kids,&mdash;there goes another.&#8221; While their
intentions were good, through lack of training
&#8220;the kids&#8221; soon came to the ground. It
is said of the flicker family that the parents
coax and coax the young birds to leave the
hole, but the latter are very reluctant to do so,
and at times the parents are constrained to
resort to starving or practically kicking
them out. In the hole three were left. Tom
brought them out and took them to a slanting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
tree. It was interesting to watch them.
Like all climbers, they have two toes in front
and two behind and in climbing are assisted
by their rigid tail feathers. Tom was kept
busy trying to arrange them within focus
of the camera. For some time it was impossible
to make them stay &#8220;posed&#8221;; they
insisted on climbing the tree. After a while
they got tired and then posed nicely for
their picture. During the whole time they
called in plaintive tone and the parent birds
answered as they hovered around. After
being photographed the birds were returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
to their home, where they seemed well satisfied
to remain.</p>

<p>This member of the woodpecker family
has some individuality. While the other
woodpeckers stay in the trees, he spends a
great deal of his time on the ground, some
of it in feeding, and some of it certainly in
amusement. He finds the latter on tree and
ground alike. I have seen them going
through various contortions and maneuvers,
some of which closely resembled the figures
in a minuet. On one occasion I witnessed
a fight between two males on the ground.
How they parried, juked, and dodged to avoid
the sally of the adversary, until finally one
got the better of the other and the vanquished
took to flight. Every spring for several
years a flicker takes up his abode near the
home of a friend of mine, who relates with a
great deal of interest how the bird attracts
attention by visiting at frequent intervals a
tin box on top of an arc-light pole, where he
takes much delight in spending considerable
time drumming away, as though the musician
of the regiment were practicing his favorite
tattoo.</p>

<p>Of all the birds of Pennsylvania the male
scarlet tanager (<i>Piranga erythromelas</i>) is the
most beautifully and attractively colored.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
Seldom seen by the occasional visitor to the
woods, like a &#8220;Will o&#8217; the wisp&#8221; he flits
through the thick foliage, uttering his peculiar
&#8220;chirp churr.&#8221; I remember well finding my
first nest of the tanager after several years of
search. On a horizontal limb of an elm tree
about ten feet from the ground I noticed a
few twigs and roots placed on the limb. So
frail was the structure that even the sunlight
shone through. Although I saw the female
fluttering around considerably disturbed, I
did not give it much thought, but left the
location, only to return again to investigate.
Imagine my agreeable surprise when,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
on climbing the tree, I saw four handsome
bluish-green speckled eggs in the frail structure
of twigs and rootlets. I have no doubt
the scanty nest is a protection, for it requires
a close observer to distinguish it as the living
habitation of a bird.</p>

<p>The green heron (<i>Butorides virescens</i>)
dwells in colonies at times, and frequently
in solitary pairs along creeks and ponds.
They build their nests on small trees and
bushes. The same birds will build in one
locality for years if unmolested, and even
if disturbed will probably find a site nearby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
the following year. I remember finding a
nest built on a small black-haw bush about
ten feet from the ground. We visited the
nest frequently until five bluish-green eggs
were laid in the frail-looking platform of
twigs. Its fragile appearance is deceptive,
however, for the nest is realty strongly constructed
amongst the limbs upon which it
rests. An egg collector found the nest and
removed two of the eggs, but the mother
bird continued to incubate. We cut the
limb off and removed the nest to the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
to photograph, then returned it, made it fast
as before, and the bird hatched out a brood
successfully from the three remaining eggs.
One day upon visiting the nest I found one
of the occupants in the act of swallowing a
frog. All that remained of the frog was a
leg sticking out of the nestling&#8217;s mouth. It
was not long before the bird disgorged the legs,
or all that was undigested of them. About
a week later I visited the nest, and looking
up saw three long necks and three heads
sticking up over the edge. Before long they
started one by one to leave the nest, stepping
rather ceremoniously along the limbs towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
the foliage at the top. Occasionally one
would miss his foothold and partially lose
his balance, but by the use of wings and
beak would right himself. Often when in
distress and hastening to get away, the young
herons will use their heads and necks as a
parrot does its beak, &#8220;chinning&#8221; themselves
upon a limb and drawing up the body by
main strength. These birds when frightened
disgorge partially digested food; and because
of their predilection to the generous distribution
of ornithological whitewash at frequent
intervals as they fly, they well deserve the
name of &#8220;chalk-line.&#8221; While climbing the
trees on several occasions when visiting the
homes of these birds, I found to my sorrow
that &#8220;discretion is the better part of valor.&#8221;
Although they seem to be extremely shy, they
will return from time to time to the neighborhood
of their nests. They do not often
approach closely, however, while a visitor
is near, and on such occasions remain at
some distance craning their necks curiously
in every direction. They seldom utter a
sound unless startled, when with a hoarse
&#8220;quawk&#8221; and a shrilly harsh cry, they
hastily fly away.</p>

<p>The rose-breasted grosbeak (<i>Zamelodia
ludoviciana</i>) is one of the handsomest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
finch family, and also one of the most useful
to the farmer. The grosbeak&#8217;s chief diet is
bugs and other insects, the potato bug being a
favorite morsel in their menu. They usually
build their nest on a bush and are very devoted
to their home, so much so that when
eggs are removed they continue to lay and
incubate the remaining eggs. On one occasion
in photographing a nest containing two eggs
it was necessary to pull the slendor bush over
and tie it within range of the camera. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
cord snapped, releasing the sapling and the
eggs were thrown out and destroyed, much to
our annoyance. On the following week when
we returned we found the mother bird had laid
two more eggs in the nest. The birds raised
their small brood as though nothing had happened.
I have visited many grosbeaks&#8217; nests,
and excepting on one or two occasions I have
not seen the female incubating. This duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
seems to be performed more often by the male.</p>

<p>The blue-gray gnat-catchers (<i>Polioptila
cærulea</i>) are among the birds who build their
nests early. When building is on, the nests
are very easy to find, but ere the young are
hatched out the foliage affords effective
concealment. Their squeaky voices attract
your attention, and looking towards the
very top of the tree you can see them flitting
from limb to limb. Before long, one or the
other draws nearer and nearer the nest; then
a quick flight, and there it is in the partly
constructed home. Watching with the field-glass
you can see them constructing the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
beautiful nest in all bird architecture, save
possibly that of the ruby-throated hummingbird,
which builds a similar home. They
usually select an elm tree, and at a height of
thirty to fifty feet saddle the nest on the
under or horizontal branch of a fork. Thus
the branching system of the elm is peculiarly
adapted to their style of architecture. It
furnishes a shelter from storm and hawk
overhead, and prowling boy or bird of prey
in the brush underneath. The nest in the
illustration accompanying the text was taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
upon an oak, which my experience leads me
to believe is an unusual site. How interesting
to watch both male and female building their
nest in the crotch! After several days&#8217;
work the structure begins to take shape and
the master touches are being put to the little
cup of lichens, moss, and grass. Alighting
in it the builders crane their necks and with
their long bills tuck in the moss and lichens
all around, much as a mother tucks the
clothing around her sleeping babe in the
cradle. When all is complete the five little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
speckled eggs are deposited and incubation
begins. The parent is quite plucky
and resents any intrusion upon the sanctity
of her home. On one occasion I saw
a downy woodpecker come too close to a
gnat-catcher&#8217;s nest. Like a streak of light
she shot out, a mix-up followed, and the
downy made haste to get away. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
time a redstart was taught the lesson that
it did not pay to &#8220;hang around&#8221; this little
bird&#8217;s home.</p>

<p>In the early spring we hear a concert of
sweet voices coming from a flock of songsters
in the summit of the elm, their favorite tree.
Their period of love-making is long, as all
their brothers and sisters of the same order
have with very few exceptions finished their
family duties before the American goldfinch
(<i>Astragalinus tristis</i>) looks about and selects
for his nest the fork of a bush or tree handy
to some thistly field. Here the family of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
three to six young is reared. From his fondness
for thistle seeds he gets his common
name, &#8220;thistle-bird.&#8221; As the thistles ripen
he can be seen picking away as he clings to
the burr in every conceivable position, releasing
the &#8220;witches&#8221; that float gracefully
off with the gentle breezes over the field;
regardless is he of the bees that tend the rose-purple
flower-heads scattered here and there
among the ripe thistle-tops. Over yonder a
colony of the delicate blossoms of the &#8220;Queen
Anne&#8217;s lace&#8221; is quite conspicuous. Hovering
around are many flies and bees. A red-spotted
purple butterfly lights gracefully on
the plant, folding and unfolding its beautifully
colored wings. He is safe from any
molestation on the part of the goldfinch, who
is essentially a seed-eater. Thus it is that
these two highly-decorated creatures may
often be seen gathering food side by side in
the meadow.</p>

<p>There are some advantages in late building,
and especially to the thistle-birds. They
get rid of the parasite cowbird, whose season
for propagation must needs be earlier in order
to afford sufficient time for development; for
the young cowbird is more phlegmatic in
temperament and slower in growth, nor
does he stay with us so late as the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
goldfinch. Again, the thistle-birds, being
seed-eaters, find a more bountiful supply
of food as the July days approach.</p>

<p>In the air they are readily distinguished
by their undulatory flight. Frequently repeating
their bubbling, laughter-like call,
they pass overhead, describing circle after
circle as though compelled thus to work off
some of the buoyancy of their nature. The
essence of cleanliness, they love to bathe in
the purling waters of the brook where the
pebbles lend their smoothness to the ever-rippling
streamlet; there in some secluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
spot during the sweltering weather of July
and August the little birds delight to splash
the crystal waters over their lemon-colored
plumage. In my earlier days I have often
caught them in the following manner: We
would thrust a branch into the ground at
one of the bathing places, and on the side of
the stream from which by prior observation
it was ascertained that the birds usually
approached. They would alight on this
branch as they came to the water, and after a
while would become accustomed to linger
on it before descending to the bath. In a
few days we would cut pliant tips of the
willow, smear them with bird-lime, and by
means of slits cut in the branch would arrange
the besmeared twigs high enough that when
the bird alighted the limed twigs stuck to his
breast feathers and swung around underneath,
sticking the wing fast to his side so
that the bird could not move. Invariably
it would fall to the ground, unable in the
case of the smaller birds either to walk or
fly, and thus became an easy prey. Of
course this was a boyhood prank, and my
love to have the songster with me at home
led me to place him in captivity. My ideas
have changed and to-day I love the birds best
in their natural haunts among the environ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>ments
in which they sing the sweetest, their
plumage is the finest, and where liberty of
flight adds to their grace and charm.</p>

<p>In selecting the place to trap the birds
where they go to bathe, one must bear in mind
that some birds will frequent one place,
some birds another. We would set out a line
of traps some distance apart. In going
from place to place we gave the birds time
to visit in our absence. If perchance a bird
disturbed the twigs, we always knew it, for
we kept the number of the smeared twigs set
on each branch. If a twig were missing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
no bird in sight, on looking around we were
sure to find the bird, if small, somewhere
near the branch, or in case of larger birds,
some distance away, for while the smaller
birds were hopelessly entangled, the larger
ones could walk but could not fly, and frequently
got away by going through the grass
and working rid of the small willow twig.</p>

<p>Among the first harbingers of spring the
red-wing blackbirds (<i>Agelaius ph&#339;niceus</i>) are
conspicuous among the swamps and meadows,
where they gather in flocks. The birds build
their nests among the cat-tails, willows, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
small bushes along the margin of swamps and
meadows. As you approach they warn you
of their disapproval in anxious tones. In
a short time, however, they cease their noise
and fly from point to point, lighting on the
slender top of cat-tail, limb or weed, gracefully
swaying backward and forward with
the gentle breezes. It is thus they show
their beautiful wings to the best advantage.
Among the cat-tails they love to build
their nest from one to three feet above
the water. A coarse grass is used to bind
the nest to the stock and within this is
constructed a bulky basket of weeds and
grass, in which they deposit four or five
whitish, bluish, or greenish eggs, fantastically
marked with dots, scrawls, and blotches,
resembling some of the illegible hieroglyphics
of the past ages.</p>

<span class="caption">Homes of the Cliff Swallows</span>
</div>

<p>My opportunity to study the ways of
the cliff swallow (<i>Petrochelidon lunifrons</i>) has
been very limited. My young friend Tom
wrote me the birds were at work, a colony
being busy building their odd-shaped nests
on the rafters of a cow barn. When I visited
the place I found the nests were built quite
close to each other. How the birds did scold
when we approached, darting around and
around at first, but, gradually quieting down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
they disappeared! In the meantime we were
trying to get a snap-shot of a bird entering
the neck of the nest. The nests were constructed
of small pellets of mud, and were
gourd-shaped, lined with grass and feathers.
There they laid their four or five white
speckled eggs. I understood this was the
second year in succession they had built in
this barn, but the following year they selected
a barn some distance away. How conspicuous
the rufous rump appeared when they entered
the nest! They never remained long, but
were off again, always on the wing. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
entered the frail structures like fairies, touching
the opening lightly, entering easily, then
reappearing, to be off again on the wing.
Sometimes they stopped for a moment at
the mouth, clogging the entrance entirely
with the body. As some writer has said,
the bird is known by its &#8220;crescent-shaped
frontlet shining like a moon,&#8221; hence its
specific Latin name &#8220;lunifrons,&#8221;&mdash;moon-brow.
One need not draw far on his imagination
to think that the moon on her brow dispenses
light for the mother bird to see the
little mouths as she feeds her young in the
&#8220;darksome cave.&#8221;</p>

<span class="caption">Nest of the Song Sparrow</span>

<p>The song sparrow (<i>Melospiza melodia</i>) is
among the first to return to its summer home.
What a cheerful, fascinating little fellow he
is as he perches on the fence post, or &#8220;any
old place,&#8221; pouring forth his lightsome,
varied songs! Clothed in his somber brown
suit, he is instantly recognized by the dark
throat patch. There is no regularity in what
they do, or how, where, or when they do it.
They build nests on the ground and in bushes,
bulky or sparse, lined with horse hairs or
otherwise, and lay eggs irregularly speckled.
They begin to build their nests about the
time the trillium is peeping through the
ground, and the brood are ready to leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
their home when the trillium is in full blossom.
How delighted the children are when, if
perchance out gathering flowers, they see
the hasty flight of the mother bird as she
quits her carefully concealed nest, and parting
the leaves, there they find a family of
fledglings, mouths wide open, waiting for
the return of the mother with food to satisfy
their wants! One day I found a song sparrow&#8217;s
nest in a small catalpa tree. On closer
examination I noticed a young bird hanging
by the neck, dead. I have no doubt that
when the bird was ready to leave the nest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
it became entangled in the horse hair, for
a loop was found around its neck, and when
the little youngster, in its endeavors to release
itself, tumbled overboard, it was strangled
to death.</p>

<p>A large percentage of the nests of the wood
thrush (<i>Hylocichla mustelina</i>) are destroyed
or abandoned from various causes. When
incubation is begun the mother bird is very
loath to leave the nest and will permit you
to come very near. The accompanying
photograph was obtained after many failures.
Day by day we approached nearer and nearer
until finally the bird allowed us to set the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
kodak within two feet of the nest, and the
click of the shutter did not disturb her,
although she seemed to quiver as if in great
fear.</p>

<p>These birds love solitude, and how charming
to listen to their sweet melodies coming from
the depths of the woodland! Often in building
their nest they select some limb or fork of a
sapling near a path frequented by lovers of
the woods. The place, method, and material
chosen by them make it quite easy to find
their home. It is built of coarse grass, which
usually streams down over the limb, while
paper is frequently used in the formation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
the lower and outer part of the nest, rendering
it quite conspicuous. Various causes, such
as hawks, owls, and snakes, contribute to the
destruction of a large proportion of these
nests.</p>

<p>One day we were walking through a strip
of woods that lay along a babbling brook,
wending our way towards a wood thrush&#8217;s
nest which on the occasion of our last visit
contained several eggs. When we came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
the nest we found the eggs had been removed,
and we left, wondering what agency was
responsible. A short distance from the nest
we saw a large black snake gliding through
the grass toward a rotten stump about ten
feet high. I set after him and he climbed a
big locust tree, on which he paused for a
moment at a height of some six feet from the
ground. Then when disturbed he slipped
over to a hollow stump, which had grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
alongside from the same base, and to our
surprise proceeded to enter a knothole that
seemed far too small for him. Not to be
outdone, we pried the stump from the main
trunk and found the snake coiled like a watch
spring tightly against the inner walls of the
hollow base. From this position he had to
be pried, inch by inch, while I pulled him out
by the tail and dragged him into an open
field nearby, where he could be photographed.
We placed a limb in the ground at an angle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
but although we tried many times, the snake
refused to crawl up. Finally we got the
original stump, placed it in the ground,
started Mr. Snake toward it, and he, immediately
recognizing his former retreat,
gracefully crawled up the tree.</p>

<p>The wood thrush builds its nest anywhere
from two to twelve feet from the ground and
on almost any kind of bush or tree. They
are not over-sensitive if one disturbs the nest.
In order to get the accompanying photograph
it was necessary to remove the nest from its
lofty position some twelve feet above the
ground to a limb about two feet high. After
taking the picture of the nest with the four
eggs, we returned it to its original place.
The following week we called and found
three of the eggs hatched. We removed
the nest and after photographing returned
it, and the birds remained until full-fledged,
as though nothing had happened to their
childhood home.</p>

<p>How elegantly dressed the American redstart
(<i>Setophaga ruticilla</i>) appears on his
arrival from his winter home! The costume
of his wife is not so flaming, but is nevertheless
very attractive. How active they seem,
flitting from place to place, at times having
all the characteristics of the flycatcher and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
again all the marks of the sylvan warblers
they are! Proud as a peacock, he spreads
his pretty tail as much as to say to his woodland
neighbors, &#8220;You can&#8217;t match me for
grace and beauty.&#8221; And well may he be
proud of his graceful elegance and his achievements
in procuring his food, for he is one of
the most charming and energetic of the
insectivorous birds. He is a creature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
action, always on the move, lively and alert,
getting all that is coming to him in quick
succession. The nest is built in the fork of
a tree or on some horizontal limb, and is
constructed of rootlets and twigs in a skillful
manner. Often plant-down and vegetable-silks
are woven into the cup much after the
fashion of the vireo&#8217;s idea. It is frequently
adorned on the outside with lichens and other
substances tending toward obliterative coloration.
If approached, the birds flit from limb
to limb in a nervous manner, much excited,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
and at times appearing as though ready to
strike an intruder. When frightened from
the nest they will return if one stands off at
some distance.</p>

<p>Down on the edge of a group of dead trees
a pair of red-headed woodpeckers (<i>Melanerpes
erythrocephalus</i>) were working away at a
height of about twenty feet, getting ready
for their anticipated brood. Tom, a boy of
fourteen years, came along and noticed the
couple at work. They were taking their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
turns methodically at intervals of twenty
minutes or thereabouts. Later the birds
completed the excavated cavity and the
female had proceeded fairly well with her
maternal duties. Tom climbed the tree to
see how she was getting along. He found
two eggs in the nest. Because of this intrusion
or some other reason, the birds abandoned
the nest and eggs and selected another stump
not far from the first, where they proceeded
along the same lines until they had excavated
another hole to their liking, and the mother
bird laid three pearly-white eggs which in
due time she hatched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>Now the birds were busy gathering insects
to feed their progeny. A short distance
from their home was an abandoned tennis-court,
grown up with grass. This seemed
to be the favorite feeding-ground of the male
parent. For hours we watched him coming
and going, always alighting on the net-post
where he kept a lookout for insects. Every
few minutes he would take a rapid flight to
the ground and again return to the post with
food, then by an easy course to the young.
To follow him with the eye in flight conveyed
the idea of one continuous line of red, white,
and blue. One day while we were watching
the tree stump a flicker alighted on it near
the hole. Like a flash came the parent bird
from some place nearby, made a dart at the
flicker, and soon put him to rout.</p>

<p>The brown thrasher (<i>Harporhynchus rufus</i>)
is an interesting member of the feathery
tribe who dwells in the solitude of some
thicket, where he is at home among the
underbrush. In order to see the inhabitants
of the woods, one should avoid light or
conspicuous clothing, dress as nearly as
may be in harmony with the surroundings,
and step about as gently as possible. You
may go through a clump of woods talking
with a companion and rarely see much that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
is happening; but go alone, gently, with eyes
and ears open, and Nature begins to unfold
some of her secrets. In the early morn the
thrashers delight in perching on a tree-top
and filling the surrounding glen with delightful
melodies. In nesting-time they become
very seclusive, and an occasional glimpse is
all that we can get of this handsome bird as
he flits from limb to limb, jerking and wagging
his tail. Sometimes they build their nest
on the ground, but more frequently on some
bush or small tree. It is characteristic of
the female when incubating to let you get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
very close before she will leave the nest. On
one occasion while walking through an open
woods I became conscious of a bright eye
fixed upon me. The gleam of an orange
iris accentuated its size, and in a second it
dawned upon me that a thrasher sitting on
its nest in a brush heap was the owner of
the eye. I proceeded to arrange my tripod
for a picture, but before I secured it she
left the nest with a graceful flight. She
flew around and around, making an angry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
noise, and continued her scolding for some
time.</p>

<p>A friend of mine found a nest with eggs on
the ground among some mandrakes. Selecting
a dark night he visited the nest and, by
keeping the bird bewildered under the rays
of a pocket flash-light, was able to set up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
camera at a distance of perhaps ten feet,
arrange a reflector and touch off a flash
powder, by the light of which he succeeded
in getting a flash-light of the bird while
incubating. She seemed to be unconcerned,
and in fact did not leave the nest. The
intruder decamped and left the serenity of
her domestic life undisturbed.</p>

<p>The young of the thrasher are instantly
recognized, for they have all the family characteristics
of the parent birds so well defined.
Frequently as late as the month of August,
and long after most birds have turned their
attention to other matters, the thrasher
devotes its time to domestic duties. Indeed
after the song season of many birds has
passed, I have found in the Ohio Valley region
the nests of thrashers and chewinks with eggs
and young.</p>

<p>Measured by the birds and their customs,
the springtime may extend, as we have seen,
far into the calendar summer. We begin
paying our devotions to the goddess while
yet the snow is on the ground, and we are
still doing homage at the shrine when the
mercury hovers about the ninety-five-in-the-shade
mark, but the change has come so
gradually that from one day to another we
have hardly noticed it. If to our worship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
we brought receptive hearts, stimulated by
keen vision and hearing, we have learned
much of practical economic value.</p>

<p>Without ever having opened the craw of one
of the feathered tribe, observation with a good
glass has taught us a multitude of things in
regard to the feeding of the different species
and their economic worth to the human race.
From a commanding position by the nest
of the yellow-billed cuckoo (<i>Coccyzus americanus</i>),
we have learned that this bird is an
invaluable ally in the war against the tent
caterpillar. The grosbeak is the arch enemy
of the potato bug; young bobwhites devour
untold numbers of the eggs of the Hessian
fly, that great ravager of the western grainfields;
the woodpeckers save many an orchard
and lawn tree from early death as a victim
of one or another of the borers. Indeed,
the tons of destruction, if we may apply the
term, devoured by our birds in a single
summer day, if it could be estimated, would
make an appalling figure.</p>

<p>But beyond all the mass of facts gathered,
which go to make up the sum total of the
world&#8217;s knowledge, is that oxygenation of
spirit, that freshness of vigor, bodily and
mental, which we derive from having left
behind the busy world for these hours of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
devotion at the shrine. I have always
thought that there was a more spiritual
quality in the religion of the Druids than in
that of most ancient heathen faiths, due probably
to the fact that their rites and ceremonies
were performed in the woods and
forests, and that in their seeking after a Force
beyond that which they saw, they received
some measure of the revelation which comes
to every one who loves the woods and fields.
To us who have the light of other revelation,
the contact with Nature brings a closer
touch and keener sympathy with the great
scheme of the Author of all creation. And
who can contemplate this without gaining
dignity in the contemplation?</p>

A PLEA FOR PROTECTION</h2>

<p>As I loiter along the banks of a sylvan
stream about the first of April, looking
for the return of some of the feathery tribe,
there falls upon my ears a sound, hoarse and
grating as described by ornithologists, but
to my ears most pleasant, for it tells me that
a fine bird, the belted kingfisher (<i>Ceryle
alcyon</i>), has arrived for the season. With
his crest plainly visible, in strong flight he
is following the course of the winding creek.
This highly original character is the only
member of the kingfisher family in our part
of the country. Yet there is little or no
protection extended to him by law. It would
be a calamity indeed if he were eliminated
from the scenery of the wooded banks, the
tossing rapids, and the still pool at the foot
of the falls. Here the silvery spray contributes
a weird touch to the scene as the &#8220;lone
fisherman&#8221; hovers for an instant, then with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
a spiral sweep makes a plunge, disappears
for a second, comes up with his finny prey,
and takes his rapid flight to some old limb,
where he consumes the fish at leisure. I have
never heard a word against this striking bird,
except on one occasion when a friend, who
is the proud owner of a lily pond, complained
about one of them making visits to poach on
his goldfish. The legislation permitting their
slaughter was passed, I presume, in the
sole interest of the fisherman. Surely this
stately bird should not be exterminated;
its chief diet is minnows and small fry,
fish rejected by the angler except for use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
as bait. To my mind the species is at present
in serious danger of becoming extinct and
should be protected.</p>

</div>

<p>I was quite anxious to get a few pictures
before he passed into history. So one bright
summer day, selecting a pool previously
observed to be much frequented, I constructed
a blind out of boughs and weeds on
the bank three or four feet away from an old
root where I had seen the birds alight as they
patrolled up and down the stream. Truly
&#8220;the watched pot never boils.&#8221; After waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
three or four hours I heard a rattling call, a
splash, and through my peephole saw his
lordship perched, dripping wet, on the very
spot on which I had trained the camera.
The shutter clicked, but it might as well
have &#8220;clacked&#8221; for he was instantly alert;
I was discovered, and away went the kingfisher,
rattling as though in defiance. In
the short instant of his sojourn, however,
my purpose was accomplished. Only the
person who has had this or a similar hobby
can appreciate my delight when I developed
the film and found it had caught the fisherman
with the small fry in his beak.</p>

<p>In building their nest Mr. and Mrs. Ceryle
select some high embankment where they
excavate a small tunnel from three to six
feet long, widened at the far end into a
chamber perhaps fourteen inches in diameter.
Here the silvery-white eggs are deposited
usually on the bare floor. They frequently
build their nest in a bank whose base is washed
by the waters of a stream. On one occasion
we opened a hole about half its length and
could see eggs in the chamber. Bridging
over the excavation with sticks and leaves,
we returned in about a week, opened it up,
and found the old bird on the eggs incubating.
We replaced the sticks and leaves without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
disturbing the bird, and the following week
the young were hatched. We thought our
opportunity to photograph a kingfisher
family had arrived. As the birds were too
small to remove from the nest, we left them
until the next week, when they were still
too young to pose well. Upon our visit a
week later, the nest was to all appearances
undisturbed as we had left it, but an examination
disclosed that it was empty save for
the partly decomposed body of a half-fledged
young bird. Whether the rest of the brood had
fared forth into the world and this one, a weakling
or cripple perhaps, had been put to death
or deserted, or whether some dire fate had
fallen upon the entire household, remains
to us an unsolved mystery.</p>

<p>Another bird that is unprotected by our
law makers is the green heron (<i>Butorides
virescens</i>). For weeks we had been studying
the habits of one of these birds and had about
decided on the location of a blind or ambush
for photographing. One day we saw our
little friend rise from the pool where we had
so often found him, and take to wing with
neck stretched forward and legs backward, in
one continuous line. He disappeared around
a bend in the stream and presently we heard
the report of a shotgun. I thought, perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
audibly, &#8220;Good-bye, little heron, good-bye!&#8221;
Sure enough, in a few minutes we met a party
of three or four coming towards us with their
guns, and a little later came to the place where
the shots had been fired. There was the
object of our study floating lifeless on the
surface of the water, with wings spread out,
not in flight, but in death. I deplored the
untimely end of the little bird. While looking
at his lifeless form I was startled by the
appearance of a stranger, who seemed more
than casually interested. As I talked with
him about the death of the heron we heard
the report of a gun several times, and I have
no doubt each report rang out the death
knell of one of our feathered friends. The
stranger proved to be an officer of the law.
I was anxious to have him prosecute the
person who killed the heron, but he pulled
out a copy of the statute that specifically
permitted the deed. I was sorry to learn
that such an act had been passed. As with
the kingfisher so with the heron; it is of economic
value in that it devours a great number
of destructive insects, as well as crayfish,
small water fry, and frogs.</p>

<p>Of the game birds, the ruffed grouse (<i>Bonasa
umbellus</i>) is far superior to all others and
well able to take care of itself against its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
most deadly foe&mdash;the breech-loading shotgun
in the hands of a crack shot. He is more
than a match for all comers. He outwits
the most carefully trained setters, and only
the old dogs after years of experience can
take him unawares. At times, when flushed,
grouse will alight on a limb of a tall tree,
squatting near the trunk, where they remain
unobserved, and this ruse frequently accounts
for the dogs being unable to find the bird
again. An &#8220;educated&#8221; bird will ofttimes
&#8220;jump&#8221; from cover, make a bee-line for a
tree, pass around it and continue its flight,
thus hidden from sight until beyond gun
reach. I have had a staunch point along a
stake and rider fence&mdash;a flush, a whirr, leaves
flying in every direction, and lo! the bird in
flight passes between two rails of the fence
and continues on the wing up the other
side until out of sight. At times I have
been fairly successful, occasionally making a
&#8220;double,&#8221; then again, obliged to return home
after a hard day&#8217;s hunt without a single bird.
Hunting grouse in western Pennsylvania is
a noble sport, one that requires strong endurance,
a good dog, and skillful shooting to out-general
the cunning, crafty fowl, who is a
problem for most hunters. How it stirs
one&#8217;s admiration to see the old dog, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
&#8220;rhoding&#8221; backward and forward, take a
trail, follow carefully, head erect, nostrils
expanded, and every nerve at its highest
tension in anticipation of a point! But the
bird is running and ere the point is made, a
whirr at the crest of the hill draws the eye,
and behold! he is a-wing, sailing over the
ravine to the other ridge.</p>

<span class="caption">Nest and Eggs of Ruffed Grouse</span>

<p>In the month of April the drumming of an
old cock-bird can be heard a long way off,
like the muffled beating of a bass drum,
beginning soft and slow, then louder and
faster until it reaches the highest pitch, and,
receding, gradually dies away in the distance.
He continues his love call, as some think it,
for a considerable time, and if you approach
carefully you may see him on an old log,
strutting about like a pea-fowl, his tail expanded,
erect, and in a semicircle, his head
thrown back and his glossy black ruffs spread
to their full extent, like the crimped and
fluted adornment of the days of &#8220;Queen
Bess.&#8221; About the middle of May he does
not drum so much, for the courtship is over
and his lady is &#8220;sitting&#8221; on the nest beside
some old log, where she lays as many as
fifteen creamy-white eggs in a little depression
lined with a few dried leaves and grass. Their
color harmonizes so nicely with the surround<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>ings
that it is almost impossible to see them.
Grouse seem to understand the law of protective
coloration, and will not flush from
the nest until they are sure they have been
discovered. Whether deliberately, I do not
pretend to say, but frequently, as she rises
from the nest, the hen grouse with her wings
stirs the leaves so that they fall upon and
partly conceal the eggs. When once disturbed
she will not let you get so close again.
As soon as the young are hatched they will
run to hide, while the mother bird is feigning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
all kinds of decrepitude to attract your
attention from the cute little brownish fluffs
of feather scampering here and there for
cover. I once knew a farmer boy who found
a nest, took the eggs home, and put them
under a hen. In due time they hatched out.
How pretty, cute, and interesting were the
little birds, and how the foster-mother
strutted about, undoubtedly proud of her
chicks! But ere long the little creatures,
wild by nature, died for want of proper food
and the maternal care required by their kind.</p>

<p>Quite different from the grouse in many
respects is the other member of the same
family, the bobwhite (<i>Colinus virginianus</i>),
the first a woodland bird, the other a dweller
in the fields. It is fascinating to follow a
well trained dog as he jumps the rail fence,
and if the wind is not favorable, slowly and
carefully follows the fence line for fear of
flushing the covey. When he gets to windward
he increases his gait and &#8220;rhodes&#8221;
backward and forward through the stubble
until he gets a whiff of the odor so familiar
to the experienced dog; then according to the
strength of the scent he puts on the brakes.
I have seen old Fan stop so suddenly that
she turned a somersault, then recover herself
sheepishly, if that term may be applied by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
way of accommodation to as brave a hunter
as she.</p>

<p>Quail are easy marks for the hunter.
Usually they &#8220;roost&#8221; in a stubble field in a
circle, heads outward, and thus they keep
warmer during the cold weather. I have
known pot-hunters to shoot into a covey in
the early morning before they began to feed,
killing almost every one.</p>

<p>It is rare sport to start out with the dogs
on a November morning after a fall of snow,
light, but sufficient to show the footprints&mdash;three
toes in front, one behind. By this time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
the birds are strong of flight and at their
best. After &#8220;heeling&#8221; the dogs, the trail
is followed. The birds will separate and run
hither and thither, always, however, coming
together again so that their tracks cross and
recross each other over the field. Snow
always makes the birds wild, and invariably
when feeding they will take to flight long
before the dogs are near enough to make a
point. A good dog takes the stubble field
with the wind in his favor. Getting a fresh
scent as the birds are feeding he throws his
head and tail in the air and &#8220;rhodes&#8221; on.
Occasionally the bird will run a short distance
before taking to wing; then the dog shows
his lack of training by running helter-skelter
as the hunter shouts, &#8220;Steady, steady, old
girl!&#8221; or &#8220;old boy&#8221;; or if well trained, the
noble fellow returns with his tail between
his legs, as much as to say to his master:
&#8220;It was not my fault they wouldn&#8217;t lie to
cover; it wasn&#8217;t my fault; give me another
chance!&#8221; The humane master cautions his
dog to be careful; the brute probably kicks
his dog unmercifully, and all because of lack
of knowledge on his part. If he had understood
his dog he would have known from its
actions that the birds were feeding in the
cornfield where there was not much shelter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
and that if time had been given them they
would have found cover and the old dog would
have made a beautiful point. The birds in
the beginning of the open season will not
make a long flight, but pitch abruptly over
handy cover, such as an old fence grown with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
briars, elder, and grass. The dogs follow
the windward side with nostrils dilated and
the delicate membrane of their olfactory
nerves detects the whereabouts of the little
feathered creature concealed in a tuft of grass
or a bunch of leaves. When the briars are
real thick occasionally the little bird does not
take to wing easily, but in great alarm runs
about, neck extended, tail expanded, and
crest erect, calling &#8220;peep, peep,&#8221; as though
loath to leave cover.</p>

<span class="caption">Orchard Nest of Mourning Dove</span>
</div>

<p>Frequently when the dogs are working a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
stubble field they put to flight small flocks of
turtle doves (<i>Zenaidura macroura</i>). Although
these are scarcely gregarious, they like to
mingle together in the fall. They visit the
fields to glean a few grains of corn or wheat
left after the harvest. On taking to wing they
make a whistling noise similar to that of a flight
of American golden-eye ducks, and beat a
hurried course to the top limb of some old
dead tree, where they spread their fan-like
tails just before lighting, then meekly turn
their heads to take in the situation. Many of
the birds are shot over the dogs in this way.
Their flesh is considered a great delicacy by
some would-be sportsmen. In the nesting
time they separate in pairs through the woods,
fields, and orchards, building in every conceivable
place according to fancy. Measured
by the usual standards, their flimsy nests
are several sizes too small for the owner.
When you approach their home the bird drops
to the ground and feigns a crippled condition
to entice you away, always careful, however,
to keep just beyond your reach.</p>

</div>

<p>The nest shown in the accompanying
photograph was happily located upon a
broad slab of bark that had fallen from a
locust tree and was curiously lodged some
feet off the ground among the branches of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
undergrowth. Here a few straggling pieces
of dried grass, sufficient merely to prevent
the eggs from rolling off, formed the nest.
To one coming up the hill after inspection
of a beautifully constructed vireo&#8217;s nest in
the woods below, the first impression would
be that this crude affair could not be the
handiwork of so neat and orderly-looking a
bird as the dove on the tree nearby; but alas!
fine feathers do not make fine birds, nor do
good clothes make good housekeepers. No
better illustration of this is needed than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
sight of a dove&#8217;s nest with the eggs or young
in it.</p>

<p>Thus in our rambles from the opening of
spring until the winter snows, we come upon
a great variety of feathered friends&mdash;some
esteemed for their beauty, some for their
flesh, some esteemed little or not at all, and
yet each one has its place in the general
system of creation, each one has its individuality
and its own peculiar characteristics
so well adapted to the sphere in which it
moves. The question often comes to us:
Is it for man to say that any of these birds
shall be deprived of the law&#8217;s protection merely
because their habits of life do not appeal to
him? A brief study of the question from an
economic point of view, aside from the
æsthetic, leads us to hope that the time is
not far distant when the several States will
afford a uniform protection to all of the native
fowls of the air, regardless of whether they
be game birds, song birds, or &#8220;other&#8221; birds,
at least until such time as a long-continued
investigation will prove beyond a doubt
that the restriction of the numbers of any
species is of substantive value from an economic
standpoint.</p>

<h2>POSTSCRIPT</h2>

<p>With the hope that it may be the means
of increasing the love of nature, and
thereby adding to the joys of life, this little
book is given to the public.</p>

<p>Laws for the preservation of birds and
animals, more than any others, need behind
them a sensitive public opinion. With this,
the law itself is almost forgotten in its general
observance, while without this support a
breach of the law comes in time to take on
something of virtue instead of crime. Whatever
tends to spread the knowledge of nature,
and consequently the love of it, makes it
harder for the man who <i>kills</i>, either for the
mere zest of it, for vanity or for purely
commercial reasons, and thus each convert
becomes, in a limited sense at least, a game
warden.</p>

<p>To the lover of Nature, the whole animal
and plant world is the quest. Unlimited
time can be spent in photographing insects,
birds&#8217; nests and birds, endeavoring to catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
and display the butterfly on the particular
plant from which it loves to extract the
nectar, the bird&#8217;s nest in the tree or the bush
in its natural surroundings, the old setter
on a staunch point among the stubble; thus
by pictorial notes reproducing various events
in natural history and creating an interest in
the study of botany, entomology, and ornithology&mdash;in
fact, preserving all the conditions
that make up the attraction for outdoor
recreation, which the American people so
much need. By this indirect method many
come to be so instructed in the rudiments of
nature that they are led to see in life a myriad
of interesting things which they could not
otherwise enjoy, and the book of Nature,
hitherto sealed to the hurrying multitude,
becomes an open volume to those who, turning
aside from the rush of modern life, bring
to its reading a sympathetic mind and an
ear attuned to catch the melodious voices,
and so,</p>

<h2>The Log of the
North Shore Club</h2>

<p class="p2">Paddle and Portage on the Hundred Trout Rivers of
Lake Superior</p>

<p class="p2">By Kirkland B. Alexander</p>

<p class="p2"><i>With over 40 Illustrations. 16mo. $1.25 net</i></p>

<p class="p2">(<i>By mail $1.40</i>)</p>

<p>The land that lies to the north of Lake Superior,
where the great god Naniboujou rules over mile
upon mile of unreclaimed wilderness, has long been a
favorite retreat of the fisher and camper, who finds
in the hush of its gaunt forests and on the twinkling
ripples of its inland lakes a secure haven from
the busy din of the cities. In Kirkland B.
Alexander&#8217;s &#8220;Log of the North Shore Club,&#8221; the
primeval beauty of this region is described by one
who is an alert and appreciative student of nature.
Mr. Alexander tells of his camping and fishing
experiences along these sequestered waters and of
the amusing happenings that seasoned his trips,
undertaken with companions after his own heart.
The book, which is well illustrated, is written in a
sprightly vein and is decidedly entertaining reading.</p>

<h2>Recreations of a Sportsman
on the Pacific Coast</h2>

<p class="p2">By<br />
Charles Frederick Holder</p>

<p class="p2">Author of &#8220;Life in the Open,&#8221; etc.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>8vo. With 80 Full-page Illustrations. Net, $2.00</i></p>

<p class="p2"><i>By mail, 2.20</i></p>

<p>Mr. Holder has fished in the deep sea of the
Pacific and in the mountain streams that are hidden
away in the high Sierras and Cascades, protected
from the rude intrusions of the crowd and accessible
only to the seasoned mountaineer. The tussles
he has had with game fish, retold in the dramatic
style of which Mr. Holder is the master, will thrill
the most phlegmatic reader, while the descriptions
of nature which the author presents will fill the
reader with a yearning for the spacious country of
mountain, desert, sea, and air, with whose unfrequented
trails and remote recesses the author is so
familiar. The book is copiously illustrated with
pictures of game, sporting incidents, and natural
scenery.</p>

<h2>Hunting Big Game<br />
<br />
<small>with Gun and with Kodak</small></h2>

<p class="p2">A Record of Personal Experience in the United
States, Canada, and Old Mexico</p>

<p class="p2">By William S. Thomas</p>

<p class="p2">Author of Trails and Tramps in Alaska and Newfoundland</p>

<p><i>Octavo, 240 pages. With 70 Illustrations from Original
Photographs by the Author. Net, $2.00. By mail, $2.20</i></p>

<p>The author makes a sportsmanlike plea for the use of a
camera rather than rifle in the quest of big game. The
appeal cannot fail to reach the hearts of all those who are
interested in preserving the life of wild animals rather than
unmercifully slaughtering them with modern firearms.
Mr. Thomas procures as much pleasure from his humane
method of hunting as does the so-called "sportsman"
whose chief desire is to kill.</p>

<p>The territory covered in the book is not only remarkable
for its extent, but also for the vivid and picturesque descriptions
of every locality visited. The remarkable
kodak pictures give one interesting glimpses of large game
in their native haunts from Canada to Mexico.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Every chapter is lively, diverting, and full of good
things. The illustrations are as interesting as they are
varied in scope.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Pittsburg Times.</i></p></blockquote>
